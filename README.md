# Knowledge Graph Creation

In this project, we will exercise important skills and technologies needed for developing a basic semantic application enabled by a knowledge graph. In particular, we will follow the following two tasks:
1. Creating a knowledge graph by populating an ontology with instances from one or more datasets
2. Applying SPARQL queries on the resulting KG to further enrich it

All these operations will be performed programmatically using `caRML` tool.
