    "bio": "Antonio Banderas, one of Spain's most famous faces, was a soccer player until breaking his foot at the age of fourteen; he is now an international film star known for playing Zorro in the eponymous film series.He was born Jos\u00e9 Antonio Dom\u00ednguez Banderas on August 10, 1960, in M\u00e1laga, Andalusia, Spain. His father, Jose Dominguez, was a policeman in the Spanish civil guards. His mother, Do\u00f1a Ana Banderas Gallego, was a school teacher. Young Banderas was brought up a Roman Catholic. He wanted to play soccer professionally and made much success playing for his school team until the age of 14, albeit his dream ended when he broke his foot. At that time he developed a passion for theatre after seeing the stage production of 'Hair'. Banderas began his acting studies at the School of Dramatic Art in M\u00e1laga, and made his acting debut at a small theatre in M\u00e1laga. He was arrested by the Spanish police for performance in a play by Bertolt Brecht, because of political censorship under the rule of General Francisco Franco. Banderas spent a whole night at the police station, he had three or four such arrests while he was working with a small theatre troupe that toured all over Spain and was giving performances in small town theatres and on the street.In 1979, at the age of 19, he moved to Madrid in pursuit of an acting career. Being a struggling young actor, he also worked as a waiter and took small modeling jobs. At that time he joined the troupe at the National Theatre of Spain, becoming the youngest member of the company. Banderas's stage performances caught the attention of film director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who cast the young actor in his film debut Labirinto di passioni (1982). Banderas and Almodovar joined forces in making innovative and sexually provocative movies during the 1980s. In 1984 Banderas made headlines in Spain with his performance as a gay man, making his first male-to-male on-screen kiss in Almodovar's La legge del desiderio (1987). Banderas's long and fruitful collaboration with Pedro Almod\u00f3var eventually prepared him for international recognition that came with his work in the Academy Award-nominated film Donne sull'orlo di una crisi di nervi (1988). In 1991 he appeared as an object of Madonna's affection in A letto con Madonna (1991).In 1992 Banderas made his Hollywood debut with I re del mambo (1992). Because he did not speak English at that time, his dialogue for the film was taught to him phonetically. Banderas shot to international fame with his sensitive performance as a lover of Tom Hanks' AIDS-infected lawyer in Philadelphia (1993), then played opposite Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in Intervista col vampiro (1994). Banderas further established himself as one of Hollywood's leading men after co-starring in Evita (1996) opposite Madonna in the title role. In 1998 he won acclaim for his portrayal of Zorro, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones, in La maschera di Zorro (1998). For the role as Zorro Banderas took training with the Olympic national fencing team in Spain, and practiced his moves with real steel swords, then he used the lighter aluminum swords in the movie. He also took a month-long course of horse-riding before the filming. He later returned to the role in The Legend of Zorro (2005). In 1999 Banderas made his directorial debut in Pazzi in Alabama (1999), starring his wife, Melanie Griffith. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Mexican artist David Alfaro Siqueiros opposite Salma Hayek in Frida (2002). He voiced Puss in Boots in the Shrek franchise.Banderas established himself as internationally known Latin heartthrob with charismatic looks, and was chosen as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world by the People magazine in 1996. He won numerous awards and nominations for his works in film, including three ALMA awards and three Golden Globe nominations, among many other. From 1996 to 2014, Banderas was married to American actress Melanie Griffith and the couple have one daughter Stella born in 1996. Outside of his acting profession, Banderas has been a passionate soccer fan and a staunch supporter of the Real Madrid Football Club. He shares time between his two residencies, one is in the United States, and one in the South of Spain.",

    "bio": "Russell Ira Crowe was born in Wellington, New Zealand, to Jocelyn Yvonne (Wemyss) and John Alexander Crowe, both of whom catered movie sets. His maternal grandfather, Stanley Wemyss, was a cinematographer. Crowe's recent ancestry includes Welsh (where his paternal grandfather was born, in Wrexham), English, Irish, Scottish, Norwegian, Swedish, Italian, and Maori (one of Crowe's maternal great-grandmothers, Erana Putiputi Hayes Heihi, was Maori).Crowe's family moved to Australia when he was a small child, settling in Sydney, and Russell got the acting bug early in life. Beginning as a child star on a local Australian TV show, Russell's first big break came with two films ... the first, Skinheads (1992), gained him a name throughout the film community in Australia and the neighboring countries. The second, Tutto ci\u00f2 che siamo (1994), helped put him on the American map, so to speak. Sharon Stone heard of him from Skinheads (1992) and wanted him for her film, Pronti a morire (1995). But filming on Tutto ci\u00f2 che siamo (1994) had already begun. Sharon is reported to have held up shooting until she had her gunslinger-Crowe, for her film. With Pronti a morire (1995) under his belt as his first American film, the second was offered to him soon after. Virtuality (1995), starring Denzel Washington, put Russell in the body of a Virtual Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far. Virtuality (1995), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers. L.A. Confidential (1997), Russell's third American film, brought him the US fame and attention that his fans have felt he deserved all along. Missing the Oscar nod this time around, he didn't seem deterred and signed to do his first film with The Walt Disney Company, Mistery, Alaska (1999). He achieved even more success and awards for his performances in Il gladiatore (2000), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and A Beautiful Mind (2001).",

    "height": 180.0,
    "bio": "Actor Ralph Nathaniel Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes was born on December 22, 1962 in Suffolk, England, to Jennifer Anne Mary Alleyne (Lash), a novelist, and Mark Fiennes, a photographer. He is the eldest of six children. Four of his siblings are also in the arts: Martha Fiennes, a director; Magnus Fiennes, a musician; Sophie Fiennes, a producer; and Joseph Fiennes, an actor. He is of English, Irish, and Scottish origin.A noted Shakespeare interpreter, he first achieved success onstage at the Royal National Theatre. Fiennes first worked on screen in 1990 and then made his film debut in 1992 as Heathcliff in Emily Bront\u00eb's Cime tempestose (1992), opposite Juliette Binoche. 1993 was his \"breakout year\". He had a major role in the controversial Peter Greenaway film The Baby of M\u00e2con (1993), with Julia Ormond, which was poorly received. Later that year he became known internationally for portraying the amoral Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993). For this he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. He did not win, but did win the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for the role, as well as Best Supporting Actor honors from numerous critics groups, including the National Society of Film Critics, and the New York, Chicago, Boston, and London Film Critics associations. His portrayal as G\u00f6th also earned him a spot on the American Film Institute's list of Top 50 Film Villains. To look suitable to represent Goeth, Fiennes gained weight, but he managed to shed it afterwards. In 1994, he portrayed American academic Charles Van Doren in Quiz Show (1994). In 1996, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Count Alm\u00e1sy the World War II epic romance, and another Best Picture winner, Anthony Minghella's Il paziente inglese (1996), in which he starred with Kristin Scott Thomas. He also received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations, as well as two Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award nominations, one for Best Actor and another shared with the film's ensemble cast.Since then, Fiennes has been in a number of notable films, including Strange Days (1995), Oscar and Lucinda (1997), the animated Il principe d'Egitto (1998), Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3's Sunshine (1999), Neil Jordan-directed films Fine di una storia (1999) and Triplo gioco (2002), Red Dragon (2002), Un amore a 5 stelle (2002), The Constant Gardener - La cospirazione (2005), In Bruges - La coscienza dell'assassino (2008), The Reader - A voce alta (2008), co-starring Kate Winslet, Kathryn Bigelow's Oscar\u00ae-winning The Hurt Locker (2008), Scontro tra titani (2010), Mike Newell's screen adaptation of Charles Dickens'Grandi speranze (2012), with Helena Bonham Carter and Jeremy Irvine, and Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel (2014).He is also known for his roles in major film franchises such as the Harry Potter film series (2005-2011), in which he played the evil Lord Voldemort. His nephew, Hero Fiennes Tiffin played Tom Riddle, the young Lord Voldemort, in Harry Potter e il principe mezzosangue (2009). Ralph also appears in the James Bond series, in which he has played M, starting with the 2012 film Skyfall (2012).In 2011, Fiennes made his directorial debut with his film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy political thriller Coriolanus (2011), in which he also played the title character, opposite Gerard Butler and Vanessa Redgrave. Fiennes has won a Tony Award for playing Prince Hamlet on Broadway.In 2015, Fiennes played a music producer in Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), starring opposite Tilda Swinton and Matthias Schoenaerts, and in 2016, Fiennes starred in Joel and Ethan Coen's Ave, Cesare!

    "name": "Salma Hayek",
    "birth_name": "Salma Valgarma Hayek Jim\u00e9nez",
    "height": 157.0,
    "bio": "One of Hollywood's most dazzling leading actresses, Salma Hayek was born on September 2, 1966, in the oil boomtown of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. Hayek has freely admitted that she and her brother, Sami, were spoiled rotten by her well-to-do businessman father, Sami Hayek Dominguez, and her opera-singing mother, Diana Jim\u00e9nez Medina. Her father is of Lebanese descent and her mother is of Mexican/Spanish ancestry. After having seen Willy Wonka e la fabbrica di cioccolato (1971) in a local movie theatre, Salma decided she wanted to become an actress. At 12, she was sent to the Academy of the Sacred Heart in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she pulled pranks on the nuns by setting their clocks back three hours. She was soon expelled. Only after attending Mexico City's Universidad Iberoamericana did she feel ready to pursue acting seriously.She soon landed the title role in Teresa (1989), a hugely successful soap opera which earned her the star status in her native Mexico. However, anxious to make films and to explore her talent and passion, Hayek left both Teresa (1989) and Mexico in 1991. Heartbroken fans spread rumors that she was having a secret affair with Mexico's president and left to escape his wife's wrath.At long last, Salma made her way to Los Angeles. The 24 year old actress approached Hollywood with na\u00efve enthusiasm, and quickly learned that Latin actresses were, if at all, typecast as the mistress maid or local prostitute. By late 1992, Hayek had landed only bit parts. She appeared on Street Justice (1991), The Sinbad Show (1993), Corsie in allegria (1991), and as a sexy maid on the HBO series Dream On (1990). She also had one line in the Allison Anders film Mi vida loca (1993). Feeling under-appreciated by Anglo filmmakers, Hayek vented her frustrations on comedian Paul Rodriguez's late-night Spanish-language talk show in 1992.Robert Rodriguez and his producer wife Elizabeth Avellan happened to be watching and were immediately smitten with the intelligent, opinionated young woman. He soon gave her her big break--to star opposite Antonio Banderas in the now cult classic Desperado (1995), which put her on Hollywood's map. The moviegoers proved to be as dazzled with Hayek as he had been. After her break, she was cast again by Rodriguez to star in his Dal tramonto all'alba (1996). Although her vampy role opposite George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino was a small one, it was a good credit to her box office name. Hayek's first star billing came later that year with Mela e tequila (1997) opposite Friends (1994) actor Matthew Perry. The film was a modest hit, and Hayek continued to rise her star in both commercial and artistic films such as: Breaking up - Lasciarsi (1997) with an unknown Russell Crowe; Studio 54 (1998) about the rise and fall of the legendary New York club; Dogma (1999), playing the muse in a somewhat odd comedy co-starring Matt Damon and Chris Rock; In the Time of the Butterflies (2001), the small artistic film which won Hayek an ALMA award as best actress; and the 1999 summer blockbuster Wild Wild West (1999). Her production company \"Ventanarosa\" produced the 1999 Mexican feature film Nessuno scrive al colonnello (1999), which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival and selected as Mexico's official Oscar entry for best foreign film.The new millennium started out quietly around Salma as she was preparing to produce and star in her dream role, that of Frida Kahlo, the legendary Mexican painter whom Salma had been admiring her entire life and whose story she wanted to bring to the big screen ever since her arrival in Hollywood. It finally happened in 2002. Frida (2002), co-produced by Hayek, was a beautifully made film overflowing with passion and enthusiasm, with terrific performances from Salma and Alfred Molina as Kahlo's cheating husband \"Diego Rivera\". On the side was an entourage of stars including Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd, Geoffrey Rush, Edward Norton and Valeria Golino.The picture was a hit and was nominated for six Oscars, including best actress for Hayek, and won the awards for make-up and its brilliant original score by Elliot Goldenthal. Hayek established herself as the serious actress that she is and, in the same year, expanded her horizons, directing The Maldonado Miracle (2003), which was shown at the Sundance Film festival. In 2003, she starred in the final of Rodriguez's \"Desperado\" trilogy C'era una volta in Messico (2003), again opposite Banderas, and has just finished After the Sunset (2004) opposite Pierce Brosnan and Chiedi alla polvere (2006) opposite Colin Farrell. Both are scheduled for release in early 2005. In the works are Robert Altman's \"Paint\" and Bandidas (2006) in which she will star with her friend Pen\u00e9lope Cruz.",

    "name": "Nicole Kidman",
    "birth_name": "Nicole Mary Kidman",
    "height": 180.0,
    "bio": "Elegant Nicole Kidman, known as one of Hollywood's top Australian imports, was actually born in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were there on educational visas.Kidman is the daughter of Janelle Ann (Glenny), a nursing instructor, and Antony David Kidman, a biochemist and clinical psychologist. She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole's father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents' native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole's first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member Jane Campion (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite Bush Christmas (1983). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in La banda della Bmx (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries Vietnam (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite Sam Neill in the at-sea thriller Ore 10: calma piatta (1989).Kidman's next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as Tom Cruise's doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance Giorni di tuono (1990), she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film Flirting (1991), then as Dustin Hoffman's moll in the gangster flick Billy Bathgate - A scuola di gangster (1991). She reunited with Cruise for Cuori ribelli (1992), the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite Michael Keaton in the tear-tugger My Life - Questa mia vita (1993). Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), but achieved her real breakthrough with Gus Van Sant's Da morire (1995). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, Jane Campion, on the adaptation of Henry James's Ritratto di signora (1996). A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in The Peacemaker (1997), adding \"action star\" to her professional repertoire.She and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for Stanley Kubrick's sexual thriller Eyes Wide Shut (1999). The couple's on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise's homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, Antonia Kidman, discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001.",

    "birth_name": "Diane Lane",
    "height": 170.0,
    "bio": "Diane Lane was born on January 22, 1965, in New York. She is the daughter of acting coach Burton Eugene \"Burt\" Lane and nightclub singer/centerfold Colleen Farrington. Her parents' families were both from the state of Georgia. Diane was acting from a very young age and made her stage debut at the age of six. Her work in such acclaimed theater productions as \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Medea\" led to her being called to Hollywood. She was 13 when she was cast by director George Roy Hill in his wonderful 1979 film Una piccola storia d'amore (1979), opposite Sir Laurence Olivier. The film only did so-so commercially, but Olivier praised his young co-star, calling her the new Grace Kelly. After her well-received debut, Diane found herself on magazine covers all over the world, including \"Time\", which declared her the \"new young acting sensation\". However, things quietened down a bit when she found herself in such critical and financial flops as Touched by Love (1980), Branco selvaggio (1981), Movie Madness (1982), Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and, most unmemorably, Six Pack (1982), all of which failed to set her career on fire.She also made several TV movies during this period, but it was in 1983 that she finally began to fulfill the promise of stardom that had earlier been predicted for her. Acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola took note of Diane's appeal and cast her in two \"youth\"-oriented films based on S.E. Hinton novels. Indeed, Rusty il selvaggio (1983) and I ragazzi della 56\u00aa strada (1983) have become cult classics and resulted in her getting a loyal fan base. The industry was now taking notice of Diane Lane, and she soon secured lead roles in three big-budget studio epics. She turned down the first, Splash - Una sirena a Manhattan (1984) (which was a surprise hit for Daryl Hannah). Unfortunately, the other two were critical and box-office bombs: Walter Hill's glossy rock 'n' roll fable Strade di fuoco (1984) was not the huge summer success that many had thought it would be, and the massively troubled Coppola epic Cotton Club (1984) co-starring Richard Gere was also a high-profile flop. The back-to-back failure of both of these films could have ended her career there and then -- but thankfully it didn't. Possibly \"burned out\" by the lambasting these films received and unhappy with the direction her career was taking, she \"retired\" from the film business at age 19, saying that she had forgotten what she had started acting for. She stayed away from the screen for the next three years. Ironically, the two films that were the main causes of her \"retirement\" have since grown in popularity, and \"Streets of Fire\" especially seems to have found the kind of audience it couldn't get when it was first released.The process of rebuilding her career was a slow and gradual one. First came the obscure and very sexy straight-to-video thriller All'improvviso uno sconosciuto (1987), followed by the critically acclaimed but little seen Braccio vincente (1987) with Matt Dillon and Tommy Lee Jones. In the former, Diane plays a very mysterious and sexy stripper and her memorable strip sequence is a highlight of the film. Despite her sexy new on-screen image, it wasn't until 1989's smash hit TV mini-series Colomba solitaria (1989) that Diane made another big impression on a sizable audience. Her performance in the hugely popular and critically acclaimed western epic as a vulnerable \"whore with a heart\" won her an Emmy nomination and much praise. Film producers were interested in her again. Another well-received TV production, Discesa pericolosa (1990), was followed by smaller roles in major films like Richard Attenborough's Charlot - Chaplin (1992) and Mike Binder's Ritorno a Tamakwa (1993), and larger parts in small independent films like Un uomo, una donna, una pistola (1992), Vital signs: un anno, una vita (1990) and Scacco mortale (1992). Indeed, the latter two films co-starred her then-husband, Christopher Lambert, with whom she had a daughter named Eleanor.Diane was now re-established in Hollywood and started to appear in higher-profile co-starring roles in some big-budget, major movies like Walter Hill's Wild Bill (1995), the Sylvester Stallone actioner Dredd - La legge sono io (1995), the Robin Williams's comedy Jack (1996) and Delitto alla Casa Bianca (1997) co-starring Wesley Snipes. However, all of these still did not quite make Diane a \"big-name star\" and, by 1997, she found herself, possibly by choice, back in smaller, personal projects.Her next role as a frustrated 1960s housewife in the independent hit A Walk on the Moon - Complice la luna (1999) deservedly won her rave notices and, at last, gave her career the big lift it needed. The cute but tear-jerking comedy Il mio cane Skip (2000) also proved to be a small-scale success. However, it was the \u00a3330-million worldwide grossing blockbuster hit La tempesta perfetta (2000) that finally made Diane Lane the household name that she always should have been.After the worldwide success of \"The Perfect Storm\", she was more in demand than ever. She played Leelee Sobieski's sinister junkie guardian in the slick thriller Prigione di vetro (2001), and co-starred with Keanu Reeves in the #1 smash hit Hardball (2001). However, her greatest career moment was still to come with her lead role in the enormous critical and commercial hit Unfaithful - L'amore infedele (2002), in which she superbly portrayed Richard Gere's adulterous wife. Her performance won the respect of critics and audiences alike, as well as many awards and nominations including Best Actress Oscar and Golden Globe nominations.Her follow-up films including Sotto il sole della Toscana (2003), Partnerperfetto.com (2005), Hollywoodland (2006), Un anno da ricordare (2010), and the blockbuster, L'uomo d'acciaio (2013), were all received and her performances were highly praised. She won further Best Actress Golden Globe nominations for her roles in Sotto il sole della Toscana (2003) and Cinema Verite (2011).She is very well regarded within the industry, adored by film fans, and has a credibility and quality that is all too rare today. Her immense talent at playing human and real characters, her \"drop dead gorgeous\" beauty and down-to-earth grittiness guarantees that she will stay on top, and she guarantee has already shown the kind of resilience that will keep her working for a long, long time.",

    "bio": "Jude Law is an English actor. Law has been nominated for two Academy Awards and continues to build a prolific body of work that spans from early successes such as Gattaca - La porta dell'universo (1997) and Il talento di Mr. Ripley (1999) to more recent turns as Dr. John Watson in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes - Gioco di ombre (2011), as Hugo's father in Hugo Cabret (2011) and in the titular role in Dom Hemingway (2013).David Jude Law was born on December 29, 1972 in Lewisham, London, England, to Margaret Anne (Heyworth) and Peter Robert Law, both of whom taught at comprehensive schools; his father later became a headmaster.

After Broadway, Jude started on the big screen, in many independent films. His first big-named movie was Gattaca - La porta dell'universo (1997), with Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke. He also had a good role in Mezzanotte nel giardino del bene e del male (1997). Jude's latest rise to fame has been because of Il talento di Mr. Ripley (1999), in which he plays Matt Damon's obsession. The film did very well at the box office, and critics loved Jude's acting.Following the success of Gattaca - La porta dell'universo (1997) and Il talento di Mr. Ripley (1999), Law's feature film career continued to gain momentum throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s with roles in such films as Il nemico alle porte (2001), Era mio padre (2002), I Heart Huckabees - Le strane coincidenze della vita (2004), The Aviator (2004) and many others.

Law and American model Samantha Burke had a brief relationship in 2008 that resulted in the birth of Law's fourth child, daughter Sophia. Law's fifth child, with an ex-girlfriend, Catherine Harding, was born in 2015.",

    "name": "Matthew McConaughey",
    "birth_name": "Matthew David McConaughey",
    "height": 182.0,
    "bio": "American actor and producer Matthew David McConaughey was born in Uvalde, Texas. His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Irish, Scottish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father's oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film.He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama La vita \u00e8 un sogno (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in Non aprite quella porta IV (1995), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Ren\u00e9e Zellweger.Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Stella solitaria (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham's novel Il momento di uccidere (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry's hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in The Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew's birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998).In 1999, he starred in the comedy Edtv (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow's U-571 (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine.In the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as Prima o poi mi sposo (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and Come farsi lasciare in 10 giorni (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Il regno del fuoco (2002), where he co-starred with Christian Bale. In 2006, he starred in the romantic comedy A casa con i suoi (2006), and later as head coach Jack Lengyel in We Are Marshall (2006), along with Matthew Fox. In 2008, he played treasure hunter Benjamin \"Finn\" Finnegan in Tutti pazzi per l'oro (2008), again with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in La rivolta delle ex (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies.That change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Bernie (2011), the wild private detective \"Killer\" Joe Cooper in Killer Joe (2011), Mud in Mud (2012), reporter Ward Jensen in The Paperboy (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Magic Mike (2012), starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey's career certainly reached it's prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), shot in less than a month. For his portrayal of Ron, Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, among other awards and nominations. The same year, he also appeared in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). In 2014, he starred in HBO's True Detective (2014), as detective Rustin Cohle, whose job is to investigate with his partner Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, a gruesome murder that happened in his little town in Louisiana. The series was highly acclaimed by critics winning 4 of the 7 categories it was nominated at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards; he also won a Critics' Choice Award for the role.Also in 2014, Matthew starred in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi film Interstellar (2014), playing Cooper, a former NASA pilot.",

    "birth_name": "Helena Bonham Carter",
    "height": 157.0,
    "bio": "Helena Bonham Carter is an actress of great versatility, one of the UK's finest and most successful.Bonham Carter was born May 26, 1966 in Golders Green, London, England, the youngest of three children of Elena (n\u00e9e Propper de Callej\u00f3n), a psychotherapist, and Raymond Bonham Carter, a merchant banker. Through her father, she is the great-granddaughter of former Prime Minister Herbert H. Asquith, and her blue-blooded family tree also contains Barons and Baronesses, diplomats, and a director, Bonham Carter's great-uncle Anthony Asquith, who made Pigmalione (1938) and L'importanza di chiamarsi Ernesto (1952), among others. Cousin Crispin Bonham-Carter is also an actor. Her maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callej\u00f3n, was a Spanish diplomat who was awarded the honorific Righteous Among the Nations, by Israel, for helping save Jews during World War II (Eduardo's own father was a Czech Jew). Helena's maternal grandmother, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fould-Springer, was from an upper-class Jewish family from France, Austria, and Germany, and later converted to her husband's Catholic faith.Bonham Carter experienced family dramas during her childhood, including her father's stroke - which left him wheelchair-bound. She attended South Hampstead High School and Westminster School in London, and subsequently devoted herself to an acting career. That trajectory actually began in 1979 when, at age thirteen, she entered a national poetry writing competition and used her second place winnings to place her photo in the casting directory \"Spotlight.\" She soon had her first agent and her first acting job, in a commercial, at age sixteen. She then landed a role in the made-for-TV movie A Pattern of Roses (1983), which subsequently led to her casting in the Merchant Ivory films Camera con vista (1985), director James Ivory's tasteful adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel, and Lady Jane (1986), giving a strong performance as the uncrowned Queen of England. She had roles in three other productions under the Merchant-Ivory banner (director Ivory, producer Ismail Merchant, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala): an uncredited appearance in Maurice (1987), and large roles in Monteriano - Dove gli angeli non osano metter piede (1991) and Casa Howard (1992).Often referred to as the \"corset queen\" or \"English rose\" because of her early work, Bonham Carter continued to surprise audiences with magnificent performances in a variety of roles from her more traditional corset-clad character in Le ali dell'amore (1997) and Shakespearian damsels to the dark and neurotic anti-heroines of Fight Club (1999). Her acclaimed performance in Le ali dell'amore (1997) earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination, a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination, a BAFTA Best Actress nomination, and a SAG Awards Best Actress nomination. It also won her a Best Actress Award from the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles Film Critics, the Boston Society Film Critics, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, the Texas Society of Film Critics, and the Southeastern Film Critics Association.In the late 1990s, Bonham Carter embarked on the next phase of her career, moving from capable actress to compelling star. Audiences and critics had long been enchanted by her delicate beauty, evocative of another time and place. Her late '90s and early and mid 2000s roles included Mick Jackson's Live from Baghdad (2002), alongside Michael Keaton, receiving a nomination for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe; Paul Greengrass' La teoria del volo (1998), in which she played a victim of motor neurone disease; Trevor Nunn's La dodicesima notte (1996), in which she played Olivia; opposite Woody Allen in his La dea dell'amore (1995); Mort Ransen's Il museo di Margaret (1995); Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein di Mary Shelley (1994); and Franco Zeffirelli's Amleto (1990).Other notable credits include her appearance with Steve Martin in Novocaine (2001), Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes, in which she played an ape, Thaddeus O'Sullivan's The Heart of Me (2002), opposite Paul Bettany, and Big Fish - Le storie di una vita incredibile (2003), her second effort with Tim Burton, in which she appeared as a witch.In between her films, Helena has managed a few television appearances, which include her portrayal of Jacqui Jackson in Magnificent 7 (2005), the tale of a mother struggling to raise seven children - three daughters and four autistic boys; as Anne Boleyn in the two-parter biopic of Henry VIII starring Ray Winstone; and as Morgan Le Fey, alongside Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson, in Merlin. Earlier television appearances include Michael Mann's Miami Vice (1984) as Don Johnson's junkie fianc\u00e9e, and as a stripper who wins Rik Mayall's heart in Dancing Queen (1993). Helena has also appeared on stage, in productions of Trelawney of the Wells, The Barber of Seville, House of Bernarda Alba, The Chalk Garden, and Woman in White.Bonham Carter was nominated for a Golden Globe for the fifth time for her role in partner Tim Burton's film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Sweeney Todd - Il diabolico barbiere di Fleet Street (2007), for which Burton and co-star Johnny Depp were also nominated. For the role, she was awarded Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards 2008. Other 2000s work includes playing Mrs Bucket in Tim Burton's massive hit La fabbrica di cioccolato (2005), providing the voices for the aristocratic Lady Campanula Tottington in Wallace & Gromit - La maledizione del coniglio mannaro (2005) and for the eponymous dead heroine in Tim Burton's spooky La sposa cadavere (2005), and co-starring in Conversations with Other Women (2005) opposite Aaron Eckhart.After their meeting while filming Planet of the Apes - Il pianeta delle scimmie (2001), Bonham Carter and Tim Burton made seven films together. They lived in adjoining residences in London, shared a connecting hallway, and have two children: Billy Ray Burton, born in 2003, and Nell Burton, who was born in 2007. Ironically, a mutual love of Sweeney Todd was part of the initial attraction for the pair. Bonham Carter has said in numerous interviews that her audition process for the role of Mrs. Lovett was the most grueling of her career and that, ultimately, it was Sondheim who she had to convince that she was right for the role.",

His artistic curiosity in exploring the human condition leads him to projects all over the world, large and small, Hollywood films as well as Independent cinema.In 1979, he was given a role in Michael's Cimino's Heaven's Gate, from which he was fired.

He started acting in theater and television guest spots. Harris landed his first leading role in a film in cult-favorite George A. Romero's Knightriders (1981). Two years later, he got his first taste of critical acclaim, playing astronaut John Glenn in Uomini veri (1983). Also that year, he made his New York stage debut in Sam Shepard's \"Fool for Love\", a performance that earned him an Obie for Outstanding Actor. Harris' career gathered momentum after that.

    "name": "John Hurt",
    "birth_name": "John Vincent Hurt",
    "height": 175.0,
    "bio": "One of stage, screen and TV's finest transatlantic talents, slight, gravel-voiced, pasty-looking John Vincent Hurt was born on January 22, 1940, in Shirebrook, a coal mining village, in Derbyshire, England. The youngest child of Phyllis (Massey), an engineer and one-time actress, and Reverend Arnould Herbert Hurt, an Anglican clergyman and mathematician, his quiet shyness betrayed an early passion for acting. First enrolled at the Grimsby Art School and St. Martin's School of Art, his focus invariably turned from painting to acting.Accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1960, John made his stage debut in \"Infanticide in the House of Fred Ginger\" followed by \"The Dwarfs.\" Elsewhere, he continued to build upon his 60's theatrical career with theatre roles in \"Chips with Everything\" at the Vaudeville; the title role in \"Hamp\" at the Edinburgh Festival; \"Inadmissible Evidence\" at Wyndham's; and \"Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs\" at the Garrick. His movie debut occurred that same year with a supporting role in the \"angry young man\" British drama The Wild and the Willing (1962), followed by small roles in Appuntamento in Riviera (1962), Un uomo per tutte le stagioni (1966) and Il marinaio del Gibilterra (1967).A somber, freckled, ravaged-looking gent, Hurt found his more compelling early work in offbeat theatrical characterizations with notable roles as Malcolm in \"Macbeth\" (1967), Octavius in \"Man and Superman\" (1969),\" Peter in \"Ride a Cock Horse (1972), Mike in '\"The Caretaker\" (1972), and Ben in \"The Dumb Waiter\" (1973). At the same time he gained more prominence in a spray of film and support roles such as a junior officer in Prima che venga l'inverno (1968); the title highwayman in La forca pu\u00f2 attendere (1969); a morose little brother in Alla ricerca di Gregory (1969); a dim, murderous truck driver in L'assassino di Rillington Place n. 10 (1971); a skirt-chasing, penguin-studying biologist in Mr. Forbush and the Penguins (1971); the unappetizing son of a baron in Il pifferaio di Hamelin (1972); and a repeat of his title stage role as Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs (1974).Hurt shot to international stardom, however, on TV where he was allowed to display his true, fearless range. He reaped widespread acclaim for his embodiment of the tormented gay writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp in the landmark television play Funzionario nudo (1975), adapted from Crisp's autobiography. Hurt's bold, unabashed approach on the flamboyant and controversial gent who dared to be different was rewarded with the BAFTA (British TV Award). This triumph led to the equally fascinating success as the cruel and crazed Roman emperor Caligula in the epic television masterpiece Claudius (1976), followed by another compelling interpretation as murderous student Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment (1979).A resurgence occurred on film as a result. Among other unsurpassed portraits on his unique pallet, the chameleon in him displayed a polar side as the gentle, pathetically disfigured title role in The Elephant Man (1980), and as a tortured Turkish prison inmate who befriends Brad Davis in the intense drama Fuga di mezzanotte (1978) earning Oscar nominations for both. Mainstream box-office films were offered as well as art films. He made the most of his role as a crew member whose body becomes host to an unearthly predator in Alien (1979). With this new rush of fame came a few misguided ventures as well that were generally unworthy of his talent. Such brilliant work as his steeple chase jockey in Champions (1984) or kidnapper in Vendetta (1984) was occasionally offset by such drivel as the comedy misfire Lui \u00e8 mio (1982) with Ryan O'Neal in which Hurt looked enervated and embarrassed. For the most part, the craggy-faced actor continued to draw extraordinary notices. Tops on the list includes his prurient governmental gadfly who triggers the Christine Keeler political sex scandal in the aptly-titled Scandal - Il caso Profumo (1989); the cultivated gay writer aroused and obsessed with struggling \"pretty-boy\" actor Jason Priestley in Amore e morte a Long Island (1997); and the Catholic priest embroiled in the Rwanda atrocities in Shooting Dogs (2005).Latter parts included the recurring role of the benign wand-maker Mr. Ollivander in Harry Potter e la pietra filosofale (2001) and Harry Potter e i Doni della Morte - Parte 1 (2010), and the voice of The Dragon in Merlin (2008). Among Hurt's final film appearances were as a terminally ill screenwriter in That Good Night (2017) and a lesser role in the mystery thriller Damascus Cover (2017). Hurt's voice was also tapped into animated features and documentaries, often serving as narrator. He also returned to the theatre performing in such shows as \"The Seagull,\" \"A Month in the Country\" (1994), \"Afterplay\" (2002) and \"Krapp's Last Tape,\" the latter for which he received the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award.\"A recovered alcoholic who married four times, Hurt was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by the Queen in 2004, and Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in 2015. That same year (2015) he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In July of 2016, he was forced to bow out of the father role of Billy Rice in a then-upcoming London stage production of \"The Entertainer\" opposite Kenneth Branagh due to ill health that he described as an \"intestinal ailment.\" Hurt died several months later at his home in Cromer, Norfolk, England on January 15, 2017, three days after his 77th birthday.",

    "bio": "Self-taught writer-director Richard Stuart Linklater was born in Houston, Texas, to Diane Margaret (Krieger), who taught at a university, and Charles W. Linklater III. Richard was among the first and most successful talents to emerge during the American independent film renaissance of the 1990s. Typically setting each of his movies during one 24-hour period, Linklater's work explored what he dubbed \"the youth rebellion continuum,\" focusing in fine detail on generational rites and mores with rare compassion and understanding while definitively capturing the 20-something culture of his era through a series of nuanced, illuminating ensemble pieces which introduced any number of talented young actors into the Hollywood firmament. Born in Houston, Texas, Linklater suspended his educational career at Sam Houston State University in 1982, to work on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. He subsequently relocated to the state's capital of Austin, where he founded a film society and began work on his debut film, 1987's It's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books (1988). Three years later he released the sprawling Slacker (1990), an insightful, virtually plotless look at 1990s youth culture that became a favorite on the festival circuit prior to earning vast acclaim at Sundance in 1991. Upon its commercial release, the movie, made for less than $23,000, became the subject of considerable mainstream media attention, with the term \"slacker\" becoming a much-overused catch-all tag employed to affix a name and identity to America's disaffected youth culture.",

    "bio": "Shirley MacLaine was born Shirley MacLean Beaty in Richmond, Virginia. Her mother, Kathlyn Corinne (MacLean), was a drama teacher from Nova Scotia, Canada, and her father, Ira Owens Beaty, a professor of psychology and real estate agent, was from Virginia. Her brother, Warren Beatty, was born on March 30, 1937. Her ancestry includes English and Scottish.Shirley was the tallest in her ballet classes at the Washington School of Ballet. Just after she graduated from Washington-Lee High School, she packed her bags and headed for New York. While auditioning for Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Me and Juliet\", the producer kept mispronouncing her name. She then changed her name from Shirley MacLean Beaty to Shirley MacLaine. She later had a role in \"The Pajama Game\", as a member of the chorus and understudy to Carol Haney. A few months into the run, Shirley was going to leave the show for the lead role in \"Can-Can\" but ended up filling in for Haney, who had broken her ankle and could not perform. She would fill in for Carol, again, three months later, following another injury, the very night that movie producer Hal B. Wallis was in the audience. Wallis signed MacLaine to a five-year contract to Paramount Pictures. Three months later, she was off to shoot La congiura degli innocenti (1955). She then took roles in La tua pelle brucia (1958) and Il giro del mondo in 80 giorni (1956), completed not too long before her daughter, Sachi Parker (born Stephanie), was born. With Shirley's career on track, she played one of her most challenging roles: \"Ginny Moorhead\" in Qualcuno verr\u00e0 (1958), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. She went on to do La legge del pi\u00f9 forte (1958) and Bella, affettuosa, illibata cercasi... (1958). In 1960, she got her second Academy Award nomination for L'appartamento (1960). Three years later, she received a third nomination for Irma la dolce (1963). In 1969, she brought her friend Bob Fosse from Broadway to direct her in Sweet Charity - Una ragazza che voleva essere amata (1969), from which she got her \"signature\" song, \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\". After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made a documentary on China called The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir (1975), for which she received an Oscar nomination for best documentary.In 1977, she got her fourth Best Actress Oscar nomination for Due vite una svolta (1977). In 1979, she worked with Peter Sellers in Oltre il giardino (1979), made shortly before his death. After 20 years in the film industry, she finally took home the Best Actress Oscar for Voglia di tenerezza (1983). After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made Madame Sousatzka (1988), a critical and financial hit that took top prize at the Venice Film Festival. In 1989, she starred with Dolly Parton, Sally Field and Julia Roberts in Fiori d'acciaio (1989). She received rave reviews playing Meryl Streep's mother in Cartoline dall'inferno (1990) and for Cara, insopportabile Tess (1994). In 1996, she reprised her role from \"Terms of Endearment\" as \"Aurora Greenway\" in Conflitti del cuore (1996), which didn't repeat its predecessor's success at the box office. In mid-1998, she directed Bruno (2000), which starred Alex D. Linz. In February 2001, Shirley worked with close friends once again in These Old Broads (2001), and co-starred with Julia Stiles in L'uomo dei miei sogni (2003) and with Kirstie Alley in Salem Witch Trials (2002).MacLaine as her own website which includes her own radio show and interviews, the Encounter Board, and Independent Expression, a members-only section of the site. In the past few years, Shirley starred in a CBS miniseries based on the life of cosmetics queen Mary Kay Ash--La battaglia di Mary Kay (2002), and wrote two more books, \"The Camino\" in 2001, and \"Out On A Leash\" in 2003. After taking a slight hiatus from motion pictures, Shirley returned with roles in the movies that were small, but wonderfully scene-stealing: Vita da strega (2005) with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell, In Her Shoes - Se fossi lei (2005) with Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette, in which Shirley was nominated for a Golden Globe in the best supporting actress category, and Vizi di famiglia (2005) with Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Costner. Shirley completed filming of Closing the Ring (2007), directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, in 2007. Her latest book is entitled \"Sage-ing While Ag-ing\"; Shirley's latest film is Appuntamento con l'amore (2010), which debuted in theaters on February 12, 2010.",

    "birth_name": "Ernst Wilhelm Wenders",
    "height": 191.0,
    "bio": "Wim Wenders is an Oscar-nominated German filmmaker who was born Ernst Wilhelm Wenders on August 14, 1945 in D\u00fcsseldorf, which then was located in the British Occupation Zone of what became the Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Federal Republic of Germany, known colloquially as West Germany until reunification). At university, Wenders originally studied to become a physician before switching to philosophy before terminating his studies in 1965. Moving to Paris, he intended to become a painter.He fell in love with the cinema but failed to gain admission to the French national film school. He supported himself as an engraver while attending movie houses. Upon his return to West Germany in 1967, he was employed by United Artists at its D\u00fcsseldorf office before he was accepted by the University of Television and Film Munich school for its autumn 1967 semester, where he remained until 1970. While attending film school, he worked as a newspaper film critic. In addition to shorts, he made a feature film as part of his studies, Estate in citt\u00e0 (1971).Wenders gained recognition as part of the German New Wave of the 1970s. Other directors that were part of the New German Cinema were Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Werner Herzog. His second feature, a film made from Peter Handke's novel Prima del calcio di rigore (1972), brought him acclaim, as did Alice nelle citt\u00e0 (1974) and Nel corso del tempo (1976). It was his 1977 feature L'amico americano (1977) (\"The American Friend\"), starring Dennis Hopper as Patricia Highsmith's anti-hero Tom Ripley, that represented his international breakthrough. He was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival for \"The American Friend\", which was cited as Best Foreign Film by the National Board of Review in the United States.Francis Ford Coppola, as producer, gave Wenders the chance to direct in America, but Hammett: indagine a Chinatown (1982) (1982) was a critical and commercial failure. However, his American-made Paris, Texas (1984) (1984) received critical hosannas, wining three awards at Cannes, including the Palme d'Or, and Wenders won a BAFTA for best director. \"Paris, Texas\" was a prelude to his greatest success, 1987's Il cielo sopra Berlino (1987) (\"Wings of Desire\"), which he made back in Germany. The film brought him the best director award at Cannes and was a solid hit, even spawning an egregious Hollywood remake.Wenders followed it up with a critical and commercial flop in 1991, Fino alla fine del mondo (1991) (\"Until the End of the World\"), though Cos\u00ec lontano cos\u00ec vicino (1993) won the Grand Prize of the Jury at Cannes. Still, is reputation as a feature film director never quite recovered in the United States after the bomb that was \"Until the End of the World.\" Since the mid-1990s, Wenders has distinguished himself as a non-fiction filmmaker, directing several highly acclaimed documentaries, most notably Buena Vista Social Club (1999) and Pina (2011), both of which brought him Oscar nominations.",

    "height": 191.0,
    "bio": "Patrick Nicolas Jean Sixte Ghislain Bauchau was born in Brussels, Belgium. His father, Henry Bauchau, is a noted author, psychoanalyst, and philosopher, while his mother was an educator who also helped operate a publishing company. Coming from an intellectual family, it's not surprising that Bauchau won an academic scholarship to Oxford University, where he received a degree in Modern Languages. In the early '60s, Bauchau became interested in film, and worked with French filmmaker Eric Rohmer; this led to Bauchau being cast in the leading role as Adrien in Rohmer's 1967 \"moral tale,\" La Collectionneuse. Bauchau and his fellow leading actors Haydee Politoff and Daniel Pommereulle were also credited with the film's dialogue. While this got Bauchau's acting career off to an impressive start, his naturalistic performance left many believing that Bauchau was simply playing himself. After \"Tuset Street\" (also released in 1967), Bauchau temporarily moved away from acting and worked with Salvador Dali constructing large pillow-like animal sculptures.In 1980, Bauchau re-launched his film career in Robert Kramer's \"Guns\", and in 1982, Wim Wenders cast him in the leading role of \"The State Of Things\". In 1984, Bauchau made his American film debut in Alan Rudolph's eccentric, romantic comedy \"Choose Me\", and through much of the rest of the decade he worked regularly on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1991, Bauchau scored an impressive role in Michael Tolkin's superb drama \"The Rapture\", and four years later the same director gave him a meaty role in \"The New Age\". Bauchau plays the villain the Bond flick, \"A View to a Kill\" and has starring roles in Entre Nous and The Music Teacher, both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film In 1996. Bauchau was cast in the television series \"Kindred: The Embraced\" as a patriarch of the living dead; while the series lasted only a few weeks, it did lead to the series regular role of Sydney in \"The Pretender\", which debuted the same year and ran for four seasons on NBC. Bauchau's higher profile in television helped him win notable roles in high-profile films such as \"Clear and Present Danger\", \"The Cell\", \"Ray\" and \"Panic Room\". Bauchau also plays notable roles in the independent features \"The Five Obstructions\", \"Twin Falls Idaho\", \"The Secretary\", \"Boy Culture\" and \"The Gray Man\" among several others. Bauchau is a series regular playing the blind seer Lodz on the HBO hit show \"Carnivale\" and recurs in NBC's \"Revelation\" and ABC's \"Alias\". He guest stars on numerous television shows including \"Castle\", \"CSI\", \"How to Make It In America\", \"Numbers\", \"Women's Murder Club\", \"House\", \"Dead Zone\" and \"24\" among many others. More recently in Europe Bauchau finished shooting the feature films \"Ladrones\" in Spain, \"Suzanne\" (France), \"Glenn\" (Belgium), \"Chrysalis\" (Italy) and Michel Houellebecq's \"Possibility Of an Island\" also filmed in Spain. Bauchau currently stars in the hit French TV series\" Mystere\". More recently in the USA Bauchau appears in Roland Emmerich's \"2012\", the Polish Brothers film \"The Sweet Smell Of Success\" and \"Extraordinary Measures\" with Harrison Ford. He recently returned from filming in Vera Cruz, Mexico on \"How I Spent My Summer Vacation\" with Mel Gibson.Bauchau speaks at least 6 languages fluently and has acted in films in different languages throughout the world. He holds passports in 3 countries including the USA.When not busy with acting, Bauchau lives in a small village outside Paris, and, in Malibu Lake, California, where he is an avid gardener, reader and art collector. He's married to Mijanou Bardot, Brigitte's sister, who also appears in La Collectionneuse. They have 5 dogs, and an adult daughter that lives in Rome.",

    "bio": "Highly acclaimed English actor, playwright, author and director continues to set the benchmark in stunning, intense performances on both stage and screen. Berkoff was born in Stepney, London in August 1937 and received dramatic arts training in both Paris and London and then moved on to performing with several repertory companies, before he formed the London Theatre Group in 1968. Berkoff had actually been appearing in uncredited roles in UK cinema since 1959, and started to get noticed by casting agents with his performances in Hamlet at Elsinore (1964), Nicola e Alessandra (1971), Arancia meccanica (1971) and Barry Lyndon (1975).Mainstream film fans are probably most familiar with Steven Berkoff via his portrayal of a trio of ice cold villains in several big budget Hollywood productions of the 1980s. Firstly, he played a rogue general plotting to launch a war in Europe in Octopussy - Operazione piovra (1983), then a drug smuggling art dealer out to kill Detroit narcotics officer Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop - Un piedipiatti a Beverly Hills (1984), and thirdly as a sadistic Russian commando officer torturing Sylvester Stallone in Rambo 2 - La vendetta (1985).Berkoff continued to contribute scintillating performances and was quite memorable as Adolf Hitler in Ricordi di guerra (1988), The Krays - I corvi (1990) and the haunting The Tell-Tale Heart (1991). Further villainous roles followed for the steely Berkoff in Facile preda (1995) and the Jean-Claude Van Damme kick flick The Legionary - Fuga all'inferno (1998). He excelled in the camp comedy 9 Dead Gay Guys (2002), played UK crime figure Charlie Richardson Snr. in Charlie (2004) and then appeared in the passionate Greek film about mail order brides simply titled, Nyfes (2004) (\"Brides\").His screen performances are but one part of the brilliance of Steven Berkoff, as he has additionally built a formidable reputation for his superb craftsmanship in the theatre. Berkoff has written and performed original plays including \"Decadence\", \"Harry's Christmas Lunch\" \"Brighton Beach Scumbags\" and \"Sink the Belgrano\", as well as appearing in productions of \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\" and \"Coriolanus\" to rapturous audiences right across the globe. Furthermore, he has authored several highly entertaining books on the theatre and his life including \"The Theatre of Steven Berkoff\", \"Coriolanus in Deutscheland\", \"A Prisoner in Rio\", \"I am Hamlet\" and \"Meditations on Metamorphosis\".",

The stockily built Charles Durning was one of Hollywood's most dependable and sought after supporting actors.Durning was born in Highland Falls, New York, to Louise Marie (Leonard), a laundress, and James Gerald Durning. His father was an Irish immigrant and his mother was of Irish descent. Durning first got his start in guest appearances in early 1960's TV shows. He scored minor roles over the next decade until he really got noticed by film fans as the sneering, corrupt cop \"Lt. Snyder\" hassling street grifter 'Robert Redford' in the multi award winning mega-hit La stangata (1973). Durning was equally entertaining in the Billy Wilder production of Prima pagina (1974), he supported screen tough guy Charles Bronson in the suspenseful western Io non credo a nessuno (1975) and featured as \"Spermwhale Whalen\" in the story of unorthodox police behavior in I ragazzi del coro (1977).The versatile Durning is equally adept at comedic roles and demonstrated his skills as \"Doc Hopper\" in Ecco il film dei Muppet (1979), a feisty football coach in I mastini del Dallas (1979), a highly strung police officer berating maverick cop Burt Reynolds in Pelle di sbirro (1981), and a light footed, dancing Governor (alongside Burt Reynolds once more) in Il pi\u00f9 bel casino del Texas (1982). Durning continued a regular on screen association with Burt Reynolds appearing in several more feature films together and as \"Dr. Harlan Elldridge\" in the highly popular TV series Evening Shade (1990). On par with his multitude of feature film roles, Durning has always been in high demand on television and has guest starred in Tutti amano Raymond (1996), Detective Monk (2002) and Rescue Me (2004).

    "bio": "Erin Gray was born on January 7, 1950 in Honolulu, Hawaii. Gray moved with her family from Hawaii to California when she was eight years old and graduated from Pacific Palisades High School. She was fifteen when a chance meeting with Nina Blanchard, head of one of Hollywood's top model agencies, convinced her what she wanted to do in life. Moving to New York City, she became one of the town's most sought-after models, in elite company with Farrah Fawcett, Veronica Hamel and Susan Blakely. Television viewers encountered her commercials for Breck, Max Factor, Clairol, Camay Soap and RC Cola, and a classic spot--for English Leather cologne--in which she provocatively declared, \"My men wear English Leather--or they wear nothing at all!\" Between modeling assignments, she studied acting with well-known coach Warren Robertson and, when television movie offers came in, she was ready.Universal was impressed by her performances on such series as Sulle strade della California (1973) and Ragazzo di provincia (1976) and signed her to a seven-year contract. Under that pact, the studio co-starred her as a tough-minded newspaper reporter in Irwin Shaw's Evening in Byzantium (1978). Her performance scored with both critics and audiences, and led directly to her role as Colonel Wilma Deering in Buck Rogers (1979). As a result, she has become a regular commuter between Hollywood and New York City, the hub of the magazine and fashion world. Many women admired her commanding role as Colonel Wilma Deering, while many men admired her beautiful looks and shapely figure.",

    "bio": "Marcia Gay Harden was born on August 14, 1959, in La Jolla, California, the third of five children. Her mother, Beverly (Bushfield), was a homemaker, and her father, Thad Harold Harden, was in the military. The family relocated often -- she first became interested in the theatre when the family was living in Greece, and she had attended plays in Athens. Harden began her college education at American universities in Europe and returned to the US to complete her studies at the University of Texas in 1983; went on to earn an MFA at NYU, and, thereafter, embarked on her acting career.Although she had acted in a movie as early as 1986, in the little-known The Imagemaker (1986), her first mainstream role, coming alongside some TV movie work, was as a sultry femme fatale in the Coen Brothers' cleverly offbeat homage to the gangster movie, Crocevia della morte (1990). Harden received good reviews for her sultry performance as Verna, a seductive, trouble-making moll. Harden thereafter worked steadily in supporting roles, including the portrayal of Ava Gardner in Sinatra (1992), a television biopic about Frank Sinatra. Harden also worked in the theater and, in 1993, was part of the Broadway cast of Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America\", playing Harper, the alienated wife of a closeted gay man. It was a demanding dramatic role, and Harden won acclaim for her work, including a Tony award nomination. She returned to movie making in the mid-1990s, continuing to turn in superb supporting performances in films and television.Harden's road to success was a long one, her work generally being overlooked because the productions were either critically panned or ignored by audiences. However, it was just a matter of time before Harden got a chance to truly show her quality on-screen, and that time came in 2000, with Ed Harris's Pollock (2000), in which she played Lee Krasner, artist and long-suffering wife of Jackson Pollock. Harden's performance was deeply moving and unforgettable and earned her the Oscar and New York Film Critic's Circle awards for best supporting actress. Continuing to work prolifically in features and television, she earned another Oscar nomination in 2003 for her supporting role in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003), Harden having earlier worked with Eastwood in 2000's Space Cowboys (2000).Harden's work often makes otherwise mediocre productions worth watching, fully inhabiting any character she portrays. She was married to Thaddaeus Scheel, with whom she worked on La ragazza di Spitfire Grill (1996), from 1996 to 2012. The couple have three children, a daughter Eulala Scheel, and twins Julitta and Hudson.",

    "name": "Martin Landau",
    "birth_name": "Martin Landau",
    "height": 185.0,
    "bio": "Oscar-winning character actor Martin Landau was born on June 20, 1928, in Brooklyn, New York. At age 17, he was hired by the New York Daily News as a staff cartoonist and illustrator. In his five years on the paper, he served as the illustrator for Billy Rose's \"Pitching Horseshoes\" column. He also worked for cartoonist Gus Edson on \"The Gumps\" comic strip. Landau's major ambition was to act and, in 1951, he made his stage debut in \"Detective Story\" at the Peaks Island Playhouse in Peaks Island, Maine. He made his off-Broadway debut that year in \"First Love\".Landau was one of 2,000 applicants who auditioned for Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio in 1955; only he and Steve McQueen were accepted. Landau was a friend of James Dean and McQueen, in a conversation with Landau, mentioned that he knew Dean and had met Landau. When Landau asked where they had met, McQueen informed him he had seen Landau riding on the back of Dean's motorcycle into the New York City garage where he worked as a mechanic.Landau acted during the mid-1950s in the television anthologies Playhouse 90 (1956), Studio One (1948), The Philco Television Playhouse (1948), Kraft Television Theatre (1947), Goodyear Television Playhouse (1951), and Omnibus (1952). He began making a name for himself after replacing star Franchot Tone in the 1956 off-Broadway revival of Anton Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya,\" a famous production that helped put off-Broadway on the New York theatrical map.In 1957, he made a well-received Broadway debut in the play \"Middle of the Night.\" As part of the touring company with star Edward G. Robinson, he made it to the West Coast. He made his movie debut in 38\u00ba parallelo: Missione compiuta (1959), but scored on film as the heavy in Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller Intrigo internazionale (1959), in which he was shot on top of Mount Rushmore while sadistically stepping on the fingers of Cary Grant, who was holding on for dear life to the cliff face. He also appeared in the blockbuster Cleopatra (1963), the most expensive film ever made up to that time, which nearly scuttled 20th Century-Fox and engendered one of the great public scandals, the Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton love affair that overshadowed the film itself. Despite the difficulties with the film, Landau's memorable portrayal in the key role of Rufio was highly favored by the audience and instantly catapulted his popularity.In 1963, Landau played memorable roles in two episodes of the science-fiction anthology series The Outer Limits (1963), The Outer Limits: The Bellero Shield (1964), and The Outer Limits: The Man Who Was Never Born (1963). He was Gene Roddenberry's first choice to play Mr. Spock on Star Trek (1966), but the role went to Leonard Nimoy, who later replaced Landau on Missione impossibile (1966), the show that really made Landau famous. Landau originally was not meant to be a regular on the series, which co-starred his wife Barbara Bain, whom he had married in 1957. His character, Rollin Hand, was supposed to make occasional, recurring appearances, on Missione impossibile (1966), but when the producers had problems with star Steven Hill, Landau was used to take up the slack. Landau's characterization was so well-received and so popular with the audience, he was made a regular. Landau received Emmy nominations as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for each of the three seasons he appeared. In 1968, he won the Golden Globe award as Best Male TV Star.Eventually, he quit the series in 1969 after a salary dispute when the new star, Peter Graves, was given a contract that paid him more than Landau, whose own contract stated he would have parity with any other actor on the show who made more than he did. The producers refused to budge and he and Bain, who had become the first actress in the history of television to be awarded three consecutive Emmy Awards (1967-69) while on the show, left the series, ostensibly to pursue careers in the movies. The move actually held back their careers, and Missione impossibile (1966) went on for another four years with other actors.Landau appeared in support of Sidney Poitier in Omicidio al neon per l'ispettore Tibbs (1970), the less-successful sequel to the Oscar-winning La calda notte dell'ispettore Tibbs (1967), but it did not generate more work of a similar caliber. He starred in the television movie Johnny Bristol torna a casa (1972) on CBS, playing a prisoner of war returning to the United States from Vietnam. The following year, he shot a pilot for NBC for a proposed show, \"Savage.\" Though it was directed by emerging wunderkind Steven Spielberg, NBC did not pick up the show. Needing work, Landau and Bain moved to England to play the leading roles in the syndicated science-fiction series Spazio: 1999 (1975).Landau's and Bain's careers stalled after Spazio: 1999 (1975) went out of production, and they were reduced to taking parts in the television movie The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island (1981). It was the nadir of both their careers, and Bain's acting days and their marriage were soon over. Landau, one of the most talented character actors in Hollywood, and one not without recognition, had bottomed out career-wise. In 1983, he was stuck in low-budget sci-fi and horror movies such as The Being (1983), a role far beneath his talent.His career renaissance got off to a slow start with a recurring role in the NBC sitcom Buffalo Bill (1983), starring Dabney Coleman. On Broadway, he took over the title role in the revival of \"Dracula\" and went on the road with the national touring company. Finally, his career renaissance began to gather momentum when Francis Ford Coppola cast him in a critical supporting role in his Tucker - Un uomo e il suo sogno (1988), for which Landau was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor. He won his second Golden Globe for the role. The next year, he received his second consecutive Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his superb turn as the adulterous husband in Woody Allen's Crimini e misfatti (1989). He followed this up by playing famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal in the TNT movie Max e Helen (1990). However, the summit of his post-Missione impossibile (1966) career was about to be scaled. He portrayed Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's biopic Ed Wood (1994) and won glowing reviews. For his performance, he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Martin Landau, the superb character actor, finally had been recognized with his profession's ultimate award. His performance, which also won him his third Golden Globe, garnered numerous awards in addition to the Oscar and Golden Globe, including top honors from the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics. Landau continued to play a wide variety of roles in motion pictures and on television, turning in a superb performance in a supporting role in The Majestic (2001). He received his fourth Emmy nomination in 2004 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for Senza traccia (2002).Martin Landau was honored with his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.Martin Landau died in Los Angeles, California on July 15, 2017.",

Her father was prominent playwright Romulus Linney, whose own great-grandfather was a congressman from North Carolina. Her mother, Miriam Anderson (Leggett), is a nurse. Although she did not live in her father's house (her parents having divorced when she was an infant), Linney's world revolved, in part, around his profession from the earliest age. She graduated from Brown University in 1986 and studied acting at Juilliard and the Arts Theatre School in Moscow and, thereafter, embarked on a career on the Broadway stage receiving favorable notices for her work in such plays as \"Hedda Gabler\" and \"Six Degrees of Separation\".Linney's film career began in the early 1990s with small roles in L'olio di Lorenzo (1992) and Dave - Presidente per un giorno (1993). She landed the role of Mary Anne Singleton in the PBS film adaptations of Armistead Maupin's \"Tales of the City\" series, playing her in Tales of the City (1993), More Tales of the City (1998) and Further Tales of the City (2001). Linney's first substantial big-screen role was as the ex-girlfriend of Richard Gere's character in Schegge di paura (1996) and her superb performance brought her praise and a better selection of roles. Clint Eastwood chose Linney to play his daughter, another prominent role, in 1997's Potere assoluto (1997), followed by another second billing in the following year's The Truman Show (1998).Always a strong performer, Linney truly came into her own after 2000, starting the decade auspiciously with her widely-praised, arguably flawless performance in Conta su di me (2000). She found herself nominated for an Academy Award for this, her first lead role, for which her salary had been $10,000. Linney won numerous critics' awards for her role as Sammy, a single mother whose life is complicated by a new boss and the arrival in town of her aimless brother. On the heels of this success came her marvelous turn as Bertha Dorset in La casa della gioia (2000), clearly the best performance in a film of strong performances. Since then, Linney has frequently been offered challenging dramatic roles, and always rises to the occasion, such as in Mystic River (2003) and Kinsey (2004), for which she received another Academy Award nomination.",

This African-American basketball player turned actor first popped up in minor roles such as a prison guard in A 30 secondi dalla fine (1985), as Andy Garcia's bodyguard in 8 milioni di modi per morire (1986) and Powers Boothe's bodyguard in Ricercati: ufficialmente morti (1987). \"Tiny\" Lister also had a stint in both the WWE (Formerly WWF) & WCW professional wrestling circuits in the late 1980s appearing under the name \"Zeus\" and \"ZGangsta\". His wrestling exploits can be seen on Summerslam (1989), Survivor Series (1989) and WWF Superstars of Wrestling (1986).However, unlike many musclebound athletic types, \"Tiny\" Lister is a reasonable actor, and he has managed to notch up appearances in over 80 movies, expanding upon his original \"fierce bodyguard\" roles to now include comedic and rather quirky performances in films such as Cosa fare a Denver quando sei morto (1995), the African-American western Posse - La leggenda di Jessie Lee (1993), as the Federated Territories President in the science fiction epic Il quinto elemento (1997), the cult comedy Ci vediamo venerd\u00ec (1995) and its sequel, Next Friday (2000).Lister has also recently appeared on screen with Adam Sandler in Little Nicky - Un diavolo a Manhattan (2000), and with Mike Myers in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), plus he's been seen in a slew of B-horror films including Soulkeeper (2001), Hellborn (2003) and Van Helsing - Dracula's Revenge (2004).

Ewen has established himself by creating unique characters in critically acclaimed films, as well as going toe to toe with many of Hollywood's biggest stars.Bremner had worked widely in theatre, television, and film for years before being cast in his breakout role in Trainspotting (1996), by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle. Having originated the role of Mark Renton in Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre production, Bremner then made waves opposite Ewan McGregor playing Spud Murphy and earned screen immortality with his character's infamous \"speed fueled\" job interview scene.Prior to Trainspotting, Bremner gave a striking performance in Mike Leigh's Naked, starring opposite David Thewlis. In 1999, Bremner received critical acclaim for his portrayal of a schizophrenic man living with his dysfunctional family in Harmony Korine's Julien Donkey-Boy. Filmed strictly in accordance with the ultra-realist tenants of Lars Von Trier's Dogma 95 movement and starring opposite Werner Herzog, Bremner played Julien its eponymous hero, requiring him to assume an American accent. He then worked with director Michael Bay in his high-profile 2001 war film Pearl Harbor (2001), proving his versatility once again by portraying the role of a wholeheartedly patriotic American soldier fighting in WWII. The following year, he stepped back into fatigues for a supporting role in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down - Black Hawk abbattuto (2001), while rounding out the next several years with roles in high-profile Hollywood releases such as Il tesoro dell'Amazzonia (2003), Disney's Il giro del mondo in 80 giorni (2004), Alien vs. Predator (2004) Woody Allen's Match Point (2005), the comedy Funeral Party (2007) directed by Frank Oz, and Fool's Gold (2005) starring Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.This past year proved to be a busy one when Bremner was invited to join the DC Universe in the Zack Snyder-produced feature Wonder Woman, directed by Patty Jenkins, co-starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, and set for release by Warner Bros. in the summer of 2017. Ewen would also reprise his unforgettable role as \"Spud\" in the highly-anticipated sequel to Danny Boyle's cult classic, T2: Trainspotting, for Sony due out early 2017. He rounded out the year with the feature The Lake, produced by Luc Besson.Currently (2017), Bremner is filming the TNT Drama Series Will with Shekhar Kapur, produced by Craig Pearce, whose writing credits include the feature films The Great Gatsby, Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet and Strictly Ballroom. The series will tell the story of the lost years of young William Shakespeare after his arrival to London in 1589.Other notable film credits include Woody Allen's You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, David Mackenzie's Perfect Sense starring again alongside Ewan McGregor, Great Expectations directed by Mike Newell, Bryan Singer's Jack the Giant Slayer, and Snowpiercer directed by Bong Joon-Ho and starring opposite Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton.

He has appeared in every Il Saturday Night Live (1975) movie since his premiere on the show in 1995. In 2002 he left Il Saturday Night Live (1975) and was the only cast member to ever receive a farewell from all the current cast members at the end of the season finale show. Since leaving the show Will has pursued a career in films. In 2000, he married Viveca Paulin, and lives in L.A.",

    "bio": "Anne Jacqueline Hathaway was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Kate McCauley Hathaway, an actress, and Gerald T. Hathaway, a lawyer, both originally from Philadelphia. She is of mostly Irish descent, along with English, German, and French. Her first major role came in the short-lived television series Get Real (1999). She gained widespread recognition for her roles in Pretty Princess (2001) and its 2004 sequel as a young girl who discovers she is a member of royalty, opposite Julie Andrews and Heather Matarazzo.She also had a notable role in Nicholas Nickleby (2002) opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, and a starring role in Ella Enchanted - Il magico mondo di Ella (2004). A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of \"Christine\" in the 2004 Il fantasma dell'opera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with Principe azzurro cercasi (2004), she couldn't take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum.Hathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following Principe azzurro cercasi (2004), she appeared topless in the films Havoc - Fuori controllo (2005) opposite Josh Peck and I segreti di Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Her desire to break out of her \"Princess Diaries\" image parallels that of her one-time co-star, Julie Andrews, who went topless in the film S.O.B. (1981) in order to break away from the image she created from her 1960s musicals. In interviews, Hathaway said that doing family-friendly films didn't mean she was similar to their characters or mean she objected to appearing nude in other films.",

He trained in Shakespeare at Yale University, where he received an MFA from the Yale School of Drama.Grier began his professional career on Broadway as Jackie Robinson in \"The First\", for which he earned a Tony nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and won the Theatre World Award (1981). He then joined the Broadway cast of \"Dreamgirls\", before going on to star opposite Denzel Washington in \"A Soldier's Play\", for which both actors reprised their roles in the film adaptation titled Storia di un soldato (1984). He appeared in Robert Altman's Streamers (1983) as \"Roger\", a role for which he won the Golden Lion for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival (1983).His television work is highlighted by a turn as a principal cast member on the Emmy Award-winning In Living Color (1990) (1990-1994), where he helped to create some of the show's most memorable characters, \"DAG\" (2000-2001) and \"Life with Bonnie\" (2002-2004), for which he earned Image and Golden Satellite nominations. David also created, wrote and executive-produced a show for Comedy Central called Chocolate News (2008).

    "height": 160.0,
    "bio": "Born to immigrants in Queens, New York, Lucy Liu has always tried to balance an interest in her cultural heritage with a desire to move beyond a strictly Asian-American experience. Lucy's mother, Cecilia, a biochemist, is from Beijing, and her father, Tom Liu, a civil engineer, is from Shanghai. Once relegated to \"ethnic\" parts, the energetic actress is finally earning her stripes as an across-the-board leading lady.Liu graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1986 and enrolled in New York University; discouraged by the \"dark and sarcastic\" atmosphere of NYU, however, she transferred to the University of Michigan after her freshman year. She graduated from UM with a degree in Asian Languages and Cultures, managing to squeeze in some additional training in dance, voice, fine arts, and acting. During her senior year, Liu auditioned for a small part in a production of Alice in Wonderland and walked away with the lead; encouraged by the experience, she decided to take the plunge into professional acting. She moved to Los Angeles and split her time between auditions and food service day jobs, eventually scoring a guest appearance as a waitress on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990). That performance led to more walk-on parts in shows like New York Police Department (1993), E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994), and X-Files (1993). In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student on Rhea Perlman's ephemeral sitcom Pearl (1996).Liu first appeared on the big screen as an ex-girlfriend in Jerry Maguire (1996) (she had previously filmed a scene in the indie Bang (1995), but it was shelved for two years). She then waded through a series of supporting parts in small films before landing her big break on Ally McBeal (1997). Liu initially auditioned for the role of Nelle Porter, which went to Portia de Rossi, but writer-producer David E. Kelley was so impressed with her that he promised to write a part for her in an upcoming episode. The part turned out to be that of growling, ill-tempered lawyer Ling Woo, which Liu filled with such aplomb that she was signed on as a regular cast member.The \"Ally\" win gave Liu's film career a much-needed boost--in 1999, she was cast as a dominatrix in the Mel Gibson action flick Payback - La rivincita di Porter (1999), and as a hitchhiker in the ill-received boxing saga Incontriamoci a Las Vegas (1999). The next year brought even larger roles: first as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in Jackie Chan's western Pallottole cinesi (2000), then as one-third of the comely crime-fighting trio in Charlie's Angels (2000).When she's not hissing at clients or throwing well-coiffed punches, Liu keeps busy with an eclectic mix of off-screen hobbies. She practices the martial art of Kali-Eskrima-Silat (knife-and-stick fighting), skis, rock climbs, rides horses, and plays the accordion. In 1993 she exhibited a collection of multimedia art pieces at the Cast Iron Gallery in SoHo (New York), after which she won a grant to study and create art in China. Her hectic schedule doesn't leave much time for romantic intrigue, but Liu says she prefers to keep that side of her life uncluttered.",

    "birth_name": "Mario Van Peebles",
    "height": 178.0,
    "bio": "Mario Van Peebles is a highly regarded director, actor, producer and writer. His directorial skills can be seen in the retelling of the epic mini-series \"Roots\" starring Forest Whitaker and Matthew Goode. Van Pebbles has directed award-winning shows such as the recent hit \"Empire\" and \"The Last Ship,\" as well as \"Sons of Anarchy,\" \"Lost,\" \"Damages,\" and \"Boss.\" As an actor Van Peebles has credits are as equally impressive.An independent filmmaker to his core, Van Pebbles grew up watching Melvin Van Peebles, his maverick filmmaker father. A true master craftsman in his own right, Van Peebles is defined as a director, screenwriter, playwright, novelist and composer; known for funding his own work.His many talents can be seen in films like his directorial breakout hit \"New Jack City,\" \"Posse\" and \"Panther;\" plus Michael Mann's Oscar\u00ae nominated \"Ali,\" in which he received critical acclaim for his role as real life minister and human rights activist Malcom X; the multi-award-winning \"Cotton Club\" written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola; Clint Eastwood's \"Heartbreak Ridge;\" and several projects with Ava DuVernay.Throughout his career, Van Peebles has brought challenging, compelling material to the screen, including his hip hop coming-of-age film \"We the Party,\" for which he wrote, directed and produced; his documentary short \"Bring You're a Game;\" and, of course, \"Baadasssss!\" This was Van Peebles' odyssey about the making of his father's groundbreaking film \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" and was one of Ebert and Roeper's ten best movies of the year for 2004.As a director, Van Pebbles has affected unusually strong performances from his fellow actors. They often remark that he creates a collaborative climate where they feel free to do their best work. He believes his background as an actor helps him approach the actor's character development process internally. Conversely, he believes being a director has made him a more trusting, nuanced actor. Being able to do both is like creative crop rotation for Van Peebles. Not many directors get the privilege of being directed by other strong filmmakers. Acting for others is still \"super exciting\" to him.In 1994, Hofstra University awarded Van Peebles an honorary doctorate of humane letters. After earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Columbia University, Van Peebles spent two years working at New York's Department of Environmental Protection before moving to Hollywood to try his hand at acting writing and directing.In addition to directing and acting in features, Van Peebles is passionate about supporting education and eco-consciousness through media. With his reality show, Mario's Green House, he teamed up with his five children and his father to chronicle the Van Peebles family's often-humorous attempts to raise their eco-consciousness as they try to go green in Hollywood. Green \"We never got to the full green, more like Olive green,\" jokes Van Peebles.",

He saw plenty of action, serving mainly on Motor Torpedo Boats, at first in North Africa. He was wounded in action during the Allied Invasion of Sicily in 1943.Following demobilisation in 1945 he became an actor, studying at the Webber-Douglas Academy Drama School from 1946 to 1948 and winning, in his final year, their Best Actor Award, presented to him by Sir Donald Wolfit.

After the London run he made his first overseas tour by going with Sir John and the Company to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). His most recent tour overseas was to the USA with the Old Vic Company in 1996, playing Duncan in Macbeth.

Other films include Il messaggio (1976) with Anthony Quinn, The Prince and the Pauper (1976) with Rex Harrison, Nelson's Touch (1979), in which he played the great Admiral himself, Peter Greenaway's I misteri del giardino di Compton House (1982), The Whipping Boy (1994) for Disney studios, a remake of Un uomo per tutte le stagioni (1988) with Charlton Heston and Vanessa Redgrave, L'isola del tesoro (1990), in which he played Ben Gunn, also with Charlton Heston, 1921 - Il mistero di Rookford (2011) with Rebecca Hall, Terence Davies's Il profondo mare azzurro (2011), as the grandfather in Segment \"G is for Grandad\" of ABCs of Death 2 (2014) and as Oggie in Tim Burton's Miss Peregrine - La casa dei ragazzi speciali (2016).Nicholas Amer has been a teacher at many of the London drama schools, including the Central School in Swiss Cottage, the Webber-Douglas School in South Kensington and also the Rose Bruford School and Drama Centre. In Australia, the Drama Academy N.I.D.A. in Sydney asked him to give classes to their students, and in Egypt too he was asked to do the same.

    "birth_name": "Domiziano Arcangeli",
    "height": 178.0,
    "bio": "Arcangeli was discovered in 1979 by photographer Helmut Newton in Venice, Italy, where he used to live: some of the photographs made the covers of international magazines. Arcangeli became a fashion model during the 1980s, and he was called by Federico Fellini at Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios in Rome for a screen test to play the young lead of a movie that eventually was unfortunately never made. However, the actor later worked in Fellini's Intervista (1987), playing himself at the time of that first screen test. Arcangeli did make his acting debut in the Italian-Japanese film Il giardino dell'Eden (1980), and continued to appear in a number of films during the 1980s and 1990s, among them Il buon soldato (1982) directed by Franco Brusati, Credo (1983) directed in France by Jacques Deray, Il fantasma di Sodoma (1988) directed by Lucio Fulci and Un amore di donna (1988) directed by Nelo Risi. He appeared in the historical drama Francesco (1989) directed by Liliana Cavani, starring Mickey Rourke, played in the well-received Tinto Brass softcore comedy Paprika (1991) and in the thriller Venerd\u00ec nero (1993) directed by Aldo Lado. At the same time the actor worked in several stage productions with directors such as Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, Luca Ronconi, Lev Dodin, Giancarlo Sepe, Jonathan Miller, and others.Throughout the 1990s, Arcangeli kept busy working in various films and television projects. He had starring roles in L'ultimo volo all'inferno (1990), in Rito d'amore (1989), in Demoni 3 (1991) directed by Umberto Lenzi, Belle da morire (1992), L'urlo della verit\u00e0 (1992), directed by Stelvio Massi, Albert Savarus (1993) based on a novel by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Estasi (1993), and Delitti a luce rossa (1996). He also played Helmut in the TV series Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna (1998) directed by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez. He was cast in Red Silk (1999) by Jess Franco, Il conte di Melissa (2001), Incubus (2002) and L'acqua... il fuoco (2003) directed in Luxembourg by Luciano Emmer. Arcangeli moved to the United States, where he already had citizenship, and was immediately cast as Popo in the Showtime/Viacom TV series Zalman King's ChromiumBlue.com (2002), and then played darker or more complex roles, such as Carlton, his first American antagonist opposite actor Jeffrey Wright in the thriller Sin's Kitchen (2004) directed by Fabien Pruvot. Arcangeli has since worked in several other independent films: Gameface (2007) directed by James Rhodimer, the thriller The Seer (2007) directed by Luigi Desole, in Kurando Mitsutake's Samurai Avenger: The Blind Wolf (2009). In 2009 Arcangeli founded his film production company Empire Films,inc., and he produced and starred in House of Flesh Mannequins - La casa dei manichini di carne (2009) directed by Domiziano Cristopharo, Virus X (2010), and The Ghostmaker (2012) both released in the United States by Lions Gate Films through Grindstone Entertainment, but also executive produced the comedy Scenes from a Gay Marriage (2012) in the same year.In 2013, along with his production company Empire Films' new business partner, Aaron Benore, and with Jake Barsha of Right Hook Films, Arcangeli co-executive produced the TV miniseries The Bathroom Diaries (2014) in which he plays Snake, and starred in the feature film The Brides of Sodom (2013) directed by Creep Creepersin. He most recently appeared as Chaka in the second season of the TV series Femme Fatales: Sesso e crimini (2011), in Giorgio Serafini's crime thriller investigation Hard Rush (2013), in the futuristic thriller written and directed by Paul Hough, The Human Race (2013), played the heavy Larry in Ivan Zuccon's psychological horror Wrath of the Crows (2013), is to appear also in a drama directed by Everett Lewis, Territory (2016), while there are a whole new slate of projects announced as completed, or in production by Empire Films, such as Orgy of the Damned (2010), the art-house thriller Travel Well, Kamikaze ready to be presented on the film festival circuit, but Empire Films (www.empirefilms.net) has also several other projects in active production with Arcangeli also set to star in a few.",

    "bio": "British actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen was born in Hammersmith, London. He is the son of Daniella (Weiser), a movement instructor, and Gerald Baron Cohen, a clothing store owner. His father, born in England and raised in Wales, was of Eastern European Jewish descent, while his mother was born in Israel, to German Jewish parents. He was educated at a private school, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Hertfordshire, and went on to read History at Christ's College, Cambridge. Baron Cohen had an interest in performing from an early age, forming a breakdancing group as a teenager and acting in amateur plays with a Jewish youth group. While at university he joined the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club, and took part in such plays as \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof\".Upon leaving University, Baron Cohen briefly worked as a model, before moving on to work as a host on a satellite TV station. In 1995, Channel 4 put out an open call for new presenters, and Baron Cohen sent in a tape featuring himself in character as an Albania TV reporter (an early prototype for Borat). He was hired and worked on various 'youth TV' projects before, in 1998, appearing in The 11 O'Clock Show (1998) which became a cult hit thanks to his character, Ali G. Ali G proved so popular that a spin-off show Da Ali G Show (2000) and film Ali G Indahouse (2002) where produced.America soon beckoned with a stateside version of Da Ali G Show. Feature film work followed with Baron Cohen providing the voice of Julien in Madagascar (2005) and appearing as Jean Girard alongside Will Ferrell in Ricky Bobby - La storia di un uomo che sapeva contare fino a uno (2006). He followed this with the smash-hit Borat: Studio culturale sull'America a beneficio della gloriosa nazione del Kazakistan (2006), for which he won a Golden Globe and was nominated for a writing Oscar. His other film work includes supporting roles in Sweeney Todd - Il diabolico barbiere di Fleet Street (2007) and Hugo Cabret (2011), and starring in the title roles of Br\u00fcno (2009), Il dittatore (2012), and Grimsby - Attenti a quell'altro (2016).",

He comes from a family of dancers including his grandmother, mother, aunt, and sister. It was at his sister's dance practices that he would stand outside the door and imitate the movements of the dancers inside. At age six, he was encouraged to step inside the door and, thus, his dance career began. His own story parallels that of Billy Elliot (2000) in that Jamie kept his dancing a secret from his friends at school. His mother had him when she was 16 and, unfortunately, he never knew his father.When he met Stephen Daldry, director of Billy Elliot (2000), Jamie adopted him as his father. Once the word about his dancing got out, he was harassed, but this only made him more determined to prove that dancing wasn't just for girls. He has proven a lot by landing the title role of Billy Elliot (2000), winning the role in an audition that included more than 2,000 boys from the northeast of England. His ensuing performance certainly justified the selection since he has not only won the hearts of moviegoers all over the world, he has also been nominated for and won a number of awards, including a Best Newcomer Award and then a Best Male Performance at the BAFTA awards.",

    "bio": "Born on 31st August 1965 in L\u00e9vis, a suburb to the south of Quebec City, C\u00e9line Bonnier was the youngest of eight children, six boys and two girls. The family was brought up in an exceptionally liberal, cultured environment by mother Raymonde and father Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e, a public sector administrator and serving politician in the mid-1970s. Encouraged by her parents to develop her imaginative side, she was entertaining the neighbors to impromptu routines in the local playground from the age of seven, which is how she discovered the 'high' that persuaded her to become an actor. Music featured largely in family life; she studied it at high school in Sainte-Foy, and can play several instruments, including the transverse flute and the accordion. She and some of her brothers had a flair for art, and she still sketches as a form of self-expression and particularly appreciates the work of the great painters. But her talent for acting led her high school drama teacher to recommend that she audition for the Conservatoire de th\u00e9\u00e2tre in Quebec.Graduating in 1987, she joined Jacques Lessard's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Rep\u00e8re, where she met Robert Lepage who invited her to play the part of Konstanz in his 1991 production of Les Plaques tectoniques in both Montreal and the UK. She settled in Montreal, joining the theatre group Momentum under artistic director Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Messier, with whom she has worked steadily to the present day, lately graduating to her own productions (Cholest\u00e9rol gratuit, La F\u00eate des morts). This theatrical output is interspersed with work at home and abroad for renowned stage directors such as Denis Marleau and Brigitte Haentjens. Meanwhile her film career, commencing with a screen version of Plaques tectoniques, Les, comprises a dozen films ranging in style from art-house to popular, under directors such as Louis Sa\u00efa, Charles Binam\u00e9, \u00c9ric Canuel and Marc-Andr\u00e9 Forcier.In contrast to many of her peers, her TV career is not saturated with long-running series and soaps, as she is critical of a lot of TV output, but her recent choices of TV drama (Tag, Le dernier chapitre) have earned her several awards. She has the ability to tackle difficult and uncompromising roles and remains determinedly indifferent to the star system, frequently changing her appearance for them.C\u00e9line Bonnier has worked with Roy Dupuis as an actor on several projects, from Million Dollar Babies (1994) to, more recently, S\u00e9raphin: un homme et son p\u00e9ch\u00e9 (2002), Le dernier chapitre (2002), Monica la mitraille (2004), and Les \u00e9tats-Unis d'Albert (2005).",

    "birth_name": "Carol Diahann Johnson",
    "height": 165.0,
    "bio": "One of television's premier African-American series stars, elegant actress, singer and recording artist Diahann Carroll was born Carol Diann (or Diahann) Johnson on July 17, 1935, in the Bronx, New York. The first child of John Johnson, a subway conductor, and Mabel Faulk Johnson, a nurse; music was an important part of her life as a child, singing at age six with her Harlem church choir. While taking voice and piano lessons, she contemplated an operatic career after becoming the 10-year-old recipient of a Metropolitan Opera scholarship for studies at New York's High School of Music and Art. As a teenager she sought modeling work but it was her voice, in addition to her beauty, that provided the magic and the allure.When she was 16, she teamed up with a girlfriend from school and auditioned for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts show using the more exotic sounding name of Diahann Carroll. She alone was invited to appear and won the contest. She subsequently performed on the daily radio show for three weeks. In her late teens, she began focusing on a nightclub career and it was here that she began formulating a chic, glamorous image. Another TV talent show appearance earned her a week's engagement at the Latin Quarter.Broadway roles for black singers were rare but at age nineteen, Diahann was cast in the Harold Arlen/Truman Capote musical \"House of Flowers\". Starring the indomitable Pearl Bailey, Diahann held her own quite nicely in the ing\u00e9nue role. While the show itself was poorly received, the score was heralded and Diahann managed to introduce two song standards, \"A Sleepin' Bee\" and \"I Never Has Seen Snow\", both later recorded by Barbra Streisand.In 1954 she and Ms. Bailey supported a riveting Dorothy Dandridge as femme fatale Carmen Jones (1954) in an all-black, updated movie version of the Georges Bizet opera \"Carmen.\" Diahann later supported Ms. Dandridge again in Otto Preminger's cinematic retelling of Porgy and Bess (1959). During this time she also grew into a singing personality on TV while visiting such late-nite hosts as Jack Paar and Steve Allen and performing.Unable to break through into the top ranks in film (she appeared in a secondary role once again in Paris Blues (1961), a Paul Newman/Joanne Woodward vehicle), Diahann returned to Broadway. She was rewarded with a Tony Award for her exceptional performance as a fashion model in the 1962 musical \"No Strings,\" a bold, interracial love story that co-starred Richard Kiley. Richard Rodgers, whose first musical this was after the death of partner Oscar Hammerstein, wrote the part specifically for Diahann, which included her lovely rendition of the song standard \"The Sweetest Sounds.\" By this time she had already begun to record albums (\"Diahann Carroll Sings Harold Arlen\" (1957), \"Diahann Carroll and Andre Previn\" (1960), \"The Fabulous Diahann Carroll\" (1962). Nightclub entertaining filled up a bulk of her time during the early-to-mid 1960s, along with TV guest appearances on Carol Burnett, Judy Garland, Andy Williams, Dean Martin and Danny Kaye's musical variety shows.Little did Diahann know that in the late 1960s she would break a major ethnic barrier on the small screen. Though it was nearly impossible to suppress the natural glamour and sophistication of Diahann, she touchingly portrayed an ordinary nurse and widow struggling to raise a small son in the series Giulia (1968). Despite other Black American actresses starring in a TV series (i.e., Hattie McDaniel in \"Beulah\"), Diahann became the first full-fledged African-American female \"star\" -- top billed, in which the show centered around her lead character. The show gradually rose in ratings and Diahann won a Golden Globe award for \"Best Newcomer\" and an Emmy nomination. The show lasted only two seasons, at her request.A renewed interest in film led Diahann to the dressed-down title role of Claudine (1974), as a Harlem woman raising six children on her own. She was nominated for an Oscar in 1975, but her acting career would become more and more erratic after this period. She did return, however, to the stage with productions of \"Same Time, Next Year\" and \"Agnes of God\". While much ado was made about her return to series work as a fashionplate nemesis to Joan Collins' ultra-vixen character on the glitzy primetime soap Dynasty (1981), it became much about nothing as the juicy pairing failed to ignite. Diahann's character was also a part of the short-lived \"Dynasty\" spin-off I Colby (1985).Throughout the late 1980s and early 90s she toured with her fourth husband, singer Vic Damone, with occasional acting appearances to fill in the gaps. Some of her finest work came with TV-movies, notably her century-old Sadie Delany in Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years (1999) and as troubled singer Natalie Cole's mother in Livin' for Love: The Natalie Cole Story (2000). She also portrayed silent screen diva Norma Desmond in the musical version of \"Sunset Blvd.\" and toured America performing classic Broadway standards in the concert show \"Almost Like Being in Love: The Lerner and Loewe Songbook.\" She then had recurring roles on Grey's Anatomy (2005) and White Collar - Fascino criminale (2009).Diahann Carroll died on October 4, 2019, in Los Angeles, California.",

A beautiful young girl, it didn't take long for photographers and agents to notice her and she began modeling at 15. In 1990 she entered the Miss Asia beauty pageant. She didn't win, but her striking looks, lithe body and classy bearing attracted the attention of several producers in Hong Kong's adult film industry. At age 18 she made her adult-film debut and her enthusiastic performances shot her to the top of the Chinese porn field. In 1997 she hooked up with a much older man, a Taiwanese millionaire, and they had a short (two-year) but stormy relationship. After their break-up in 1999, Chan's personal and professional lives began to unravel. She had had a drug problem for several years and it got worse--during one television interview in which she was apparently high on drugs she actually tried to commit suicide. A series of brushes with the law ensued, resulting in her being deported from several countries, and she was briefly sent to prison in the UK for assault. These and other incidents pretty much pulled the plug on her film career.She moved back to her hometown of Shanghai and in July of 2002 gave birth to a baby boy. Motherhood didn't solve her problems, however, and on July 31, 2002, she leaped out of the window of her 24th-floor apartment and plunged to her death.",

    "bio": "British stage and screen actor whose characters typically displayed indecision or timidity, usually mild-mannered or naive types who tended to come to a sticky end somewhere along the line. Collings began acting professionally with the Liverpool Repertory Theatre in the early 60s. Though having never attended drama school, he nonetheless segued successfully into television work following the advice of a fellow actor. On screen from 1965, he initially appeared in several prominent cop shows (Z Cars (1962), Softly Softly (1966)) but became ultimately best known for his work in science fiction, often having undergone extensive alien make-up. He was notable as an alien kidnap victim turned into a human bomb in UFO: The Psychobombs (1970) and as a 'Vogan' renegade scientist out to destroy (and, of course, expiring in the process) the perennial robotic nemesis in Revenge of the Cybermen. Having enjoyed the experience, he popped up twice more in Doctor Who (1963) instalments: as the driver of a mining vehicle on an extraterrestrial world who suffers from the unfortunate malady 'robophobia' while confronting The Robots of Death and as the titular antagonist (on this occasion playing an immortal, but mutated and disfigured alien scientist) in Mawdryn Undead.Collings also specialised in period drama, particularly effective as the often mistreated and underpaid clerk Bob Cratchit in La pi\u00f9 bella storia di Dickens (1970), the spy John Barsad (aka Solomon Pross) in A Tale of Two Cities (1980), the Russian liberal politician Pavel Nikolayevich Milyukov in Fall of Eagles (1974) and British Tory Prime Minister William Pitt in the miniseries Prince Regent (1979). On stage, he portrayed Lord Stanley in a National Theatre production of Richard III and the King of France in Henry V at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. He provided the voice for Legolas in the BBC 4 radio serial The Lord of the Rings.",

    "name": "Chris Evans",
    "birth_name": "Christopher Robert Evans",
    "height": 183.0,
    "bio": "Christopher Robert Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is congressman Mike Capuano. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister, Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother named Scott Evans, who is also an actor, and a sister named Shana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on Il fuggitivo (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in Cherry Falls - Il paese del male (2000) and The Newcomers (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in Boston Public (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, Non \u00e8 un'altra stupida commedia americana (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.After filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - Oggi sposi... niente sesso (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, The Perfect Score (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, Cellular (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, Cellular (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in I Fantastici 4 (2005), 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.The year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance. Il diario di una tata (2007), where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie La notte non aspetta (2008), playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie L'amore impossibile di Fisher Willow (2008).",

    "height": 185.0,
    "bio": "J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that's what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others.After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother's collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play \"Dylan's Ghost\" at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_.Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he's almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he's come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director's second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way's New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist's print worth $80.",

    "bio": "Hannah Dakota Fanning was born on the 23rd of February 1994, in Conyers, Georgia, USA, to Heather Joy (Arrington) and Steven Fanning. Her mother played professional tennis, and her father, now an electronics salesman, played minor league baseball. She is of German, Irish, English, French, and Channel Islander descent. Before her debut into the cinematic world, Dakota did her own acting around her house. She was very active for her age, and often put a blanket under her shirt and pretended to be having a baby, using her younger sister, Elle Fanning, who is also an actress now, as the baby. Dakota went to a playhouse near her home, where the children that attended put on a play every week to show to their parents. But the people running the playhouse noticed that Dakota stood out, and advised her parents to take her to an agency. They believed that she was extremely talented.The Fanning family were advised to spend six weeks in Los Angeles, a long way from their home in Georgia. But there Dakota managed to get her first work; to star in a national Tide commercial. She was chosen out of many, many other children.The family then decided to move to Los Angeles permanently, for it looked like Dakota's career was looking very good. After they moved, Dakota signed with a professional agency, and soon won a role in the movie I gattoni (2001). She then went onto a small project called Father Xmas (2001) as Clairee.But Dakota's big break-through was yet to come. She auditioned for one of the main characters in Mi chiamo Sam (2001), and the director and the rest of the crew were amazed by her extraordinary talent. Dakota was cast, and starred in the movie as Lucy Diamond Dawson, alongside major Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer.After Mi chiamo Sam (2001) her talent was immediately recognized around the world. She went straight onto 24 ore (2002) as Abby Jennings, alongside Charlize Theron, then played the younger version of Reese Witherspoon in 2002's Tutta colpa dell'amore - Sweet home Alabama (2002) But Dakota still had two more movies to come in 2002. Firstly she got a huge role in Steven Spielberg's Taken (2002), the mini-TV series, and narrated the ten whole episodes, as well as having a part. This was a little more challenging, as she was playing a troubled alien child, but she managed to do brilliantly. Her last movie for 2002 was the children's movie Hansel & Gretel (2002) as Katie.2003 was also a brilliant year for Dakota, as she starred in a number of exciting projects. Firstly, it was as Sally Walden in Il gatto... e il cappello matto (2003) with Mike Myers, then she played Lorraine \"Ray\" Schleine, a bratty little girl, in the sweet comedy Le ragazze dei quartieri alti (2003) alongside Brittany Murphy. She then voiced preschool Kim in Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time (2003).In 2004, Dakota appeared in the violent thriller, Man on Fire - Il fuoco della vendetta (2004), alongside Denzel Washington. Her reviews were excellent.First in 2005 was 9 vite da donna (2005), as Maria, then the chilling Nascosto nel buio (2005) alongside Robert De Niro. By now, she was the busiest child actress in Hollywood, with a resume to die for. Her younger sister, (Elle Fanning), had also been discovered a few years earlier.After Nascosto nel buio (2005) came La guerra dei mondi (2005), which was one of her major movies out of everything she'd worked in. Not only did it make her more popular, but she got to play the daughter of A-list Hollywood actor Tom Cruise. They had four very successful premieres; the first in Tokyo, Japan, the second in France, the third in London, England and the fourth in New York, USA. The reviews were outstanding, especially Dakota's. She then voiced Lilo in Lilo & Stitch 2: Che disastro, Stitch! (2005).",

His mother is Jewish and his father was of Portuguese and Swedish descent.Growing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie's Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Freaks and Geeks (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Freaks and Geeks (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries To Serve and Protect (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Costi quel che costi (2000).Although he'd been working steadily, it wasn't until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean - La storia vera (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man's best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy.Next was Deuces Wild. I guerrieri di New York (2002) and Colpevole d'omicidio (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean - La storia vera (2001). He was seen in David Gordon Green's Strafumati (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe's Come un uragano (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis' Nella valle di Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Definitely growing out of his shyness, James Franco is turning into a legend of his own.",

Their first hit was the Beastie Boys parody \"Stutter Rap\" which in 1988 hit #4 in the UK charts, #2 in Australia and #14 in Canada. Their follow up single \"This is the Chorus\" a spot-on dig at the Stock, Aitken and Waterman music writing machine failed to live up to the first effort and entered the UK charts at #95. It faired only very marginally better in Australia hitting #22. After gaining the prestigious accolade of one-hit wonder Tony toured with the group for many years on the comedy circuit before departing from the act and even wrote and starred in UK series Morris Minor's Marvellous Motors (1989) which lasted 1 series.These days a stand-up comedian, singer and writer he has recently been collaborating with music projects with sort of namesake Chesney Hawkes and Ash Alexander. He regularly appears as a panelist on radio and television including: Grumpy Old Men (2003), Have I Got News for You (1990) and was a regular favorite guest actor/voice on Red Dwarf (1988). He has written 4 books including: \"One Hit Wonderland\", written for obvious reasons; \"Round Ireland with a Fridge\" the result of a bet he'd made with a friend; \"Playing the Moldavans at Tennis\" another result of drunken bet and most recently \"A Piano in the Pyrenees\". Tony donated half of his royalties from \"Playing the Moldovans at Tennis\" to a trust fund for Moldova which was used to open the Hippocrates Centre, a medical centre that provides rehabilitative therapy for disabled children from socially vulnerable families.

    "bio": "Tom Hooper was educated at one of England's most prestigious schools, Westminster. His first film, Runaway Dog, was made when he was 13 years old and shot on a Clockwork 16mm Bolex camera, using 100 feet of film. At age 18, he wrote, directed and produced the short film Painted Faces (1992), which premiered at the London Film Festival; it was released theatrically and later shown on Channel 4. He studied English at England's top university, Oxford. At Oxford University, he directed theatre productions starring his contemporaries Kate Beckinsale and Emily Mortimer, and directed his first television commercials. His father was a non-executive director at United News and Media, which owned an ITV franchise.Hooper's father introduced him to one of British television's top directors and producers, Matthew Robinson, who gave him breaks by employing him to direct episodes of Byker Grove (1989) and EastEnders (1985), both series produced by Robinson. Further success came when he was approved by Helen Mirren to direct her in Prime Suspect 6: The Last Witness (2003). He then worked with her again on Elizabeth I (2005). Hooper made the difficult transition from television to film with apparent ease, directing Michael Sheen in the Brian Clough biopic Il maledetto United (2009) and Colin Firth in Il discorso del re (2010). Both films were critical and commercial successes, quickly establishing Hooper as one of the most in demand directors of his generation.Hooper has garnered numerous awards in his career. He won an Academy Award for directing The King's Speech. The 2010 film was nominated for 12 Oscars, more than any other film of that year, and also won the Best Picture, Best Actor (Colin Firth), and Best Original Screenplay Oscars. The King's Speech received seven BAFTA Awards, including Best Film and Outstanding British Film. Hooper also won a Directors Guild of America Award for his direction. Among other accolades worldwide, The King's Speech additionally was honored with the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival; the Best British Film prize at the British Independent Film Awards; the Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film; the Producers Guild of America Awards' top prize; and the European Film Award for Best Film. The King's Speech earned $414 million at the worldwide box office.Hooper was recently again a Directors Guild of America Award nominee for directing Working Title Films' Les Mis\u00e9rables. The 2012 film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won the Best Supporting Actress (Anne Hathaway), Best Sound, and Best Make-up and Hair Styling Academy Awards. Les Mis\u00e9rables received those same accolades at the BAFTA Awards, as well as the BAFTA for Best Production Design. Among other accolades worldwide, Les Mis\u00e9rables was named one of the year's 10 Best Films by the American Film Institute with an AFI Award; won three Golden Globe Awards including Best Picture [Musical/Comedy]; was voted the Best Acting by an Ensemble award by the National Board of Review; and was nominated for four Screen Actors Guild Awards. Les Mis\u00e9rables earned $442 million at the worldwide box office.The Damned United received a South Bank Show Award nomination for Best British Film; and he gained acclaim for the BAFTA Award-nominated Red Dust, starring Hilary Swank and Chiwetel Ejiofor.Hooper had an unprecedented run of success at the Golden Globe Awards with his works for HBO, which won the Golden Globe for Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television three years in a row. The actors and actresses starring in these productions - respectively, Elizabeth I, Longford, and John Adams - also won Golden Globes for their performances three years running.Hooper won an Emmy Award for directing Elizabeth I.

    "birth_name": "Stanley Lloyd Kaufman Jr.",
    "height": 166.0,
    "bio": "Stanley Lloyd Kaufman never really wanted to make movies, but wanted to work in Broadway musicals. During his years in Yale, though, he got introduced to \"B\" pictures and the works of Roger Corman. Lloyd later got the opportunity to executive-produce a short movie made by a fellow student. The film, called \"Rappacini\", got him even more interested in movies. He bought his own camera and took it with him to Chad, Africa, were he spent his summer. There, he shot a 15-minute film of a pig being slaughtered. That was his first movie, and was the birth of what was later to become known as Troma Films. He showed the footage of the squealing pig being killed to his family, and their shocked reaction to it made him wonder if making movies that shocked audiences would keep them in their seats to see what would happen next.He wanted to be a director right then and there, so he got a couple of friends at Yale and made his second movie, The Girl Who Returned (1969). People loved it, and he went straight to work on other films, helping out on projects like La guerra del cittadino Joe (1970), Rocky (1976) and La febbre del sabato sera (1977).Lloyd put in a lot of long, hard hours in the film business, just to be in the credits and to get money for his next project, a full-length feature. It was a tribute to Charles Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and the classic era of silent-film comedy. Even though Lloyd hated the movie when it was finally completed, people seemed to love it. He formed a studio called 15th Street Films with friends and producers Frank Vitale and Oliver Stone. Together, they made Sugar Cookies (1973) and Il pornocchio (1971), directed by John G. Avildsen. A friend from Yale, Michael Herz, saw Lloyd in a small scene in \"Cry Uncle\" and contacted him to try to get into the film business, too. Kaufman took Herz in, as the company needed some help after Oliver Stone quit to make his own movies. Michael invested in a film they thought would be their biggest hit yet, Ha-Balash Ha'Amitz Shvartz (1973) (aka \"Big Gus, What's the Fuss?\"). It turned out to be a huge flop and 15th Street Films was ruined. Lloyd and Michael owed thousands of dollars to producers and friends and family members who had invested in the picture.Lloyd, trying to find a quick way to pay off the bills, made The Divine Obsession (1976), and with Michael formed Troma Studios, hoping to make some decent movies, since they only owned the rights to films they thought were poor. They were introduced to Joel M. Reed, who had an unfinished movie called \"Master Sardu and the Horror Trio\". The film was re-edited and completed at Troma Studios (which actually consisted of just one room) during 1975, re-titled and released in 1976 as The Incredible Torture Show (1976) (aka \"Bloodsucking Freaks\"). It was enough of a success to enable them to pay the rent so they wouldn't lose the company.Lloyd later got a call from a theater that wanted a \"sexy movie\" like The Divine Obsession (1976), but about softball (!). The resulting film, Squeeze Play (1979), used up all the money Troma had earned from \"Bloodsucking Freaks\" and, as it turned out, no one wanted to see it--not even the theater owner who wanted it made in the first place (he actually wanted a porno movie). Just when things looked their darkest, they got a call from another theater which was scheduled to show a film, but the distributor pulled it at the last minute. Troma rushed \"Squeeze Play\" right over, and it turned out to be a huge hit. Lloyd, Michael and Troma eventually made millions from it, and had enough money to buy their own building (which still remains as Troma Headquarters). Troma then turned out a stream of \"sexy\" comedies--i.e., Waitress! (1981), The First Turn-On!! (1983), Stuck on You! (1982)--but there was a glut of \"T&A\" films on the market. Troma noticed that a lot of comedies were being made, and decided to make one, too, but much different than the rest. After reading an article that claimed horror movies were dead, Lloyd got the idea to combine both horror and comedy, and Troma came up with \"Health Club Horror\"--later retitled and released as The Toxic Avenger - Il vendicatore tossico (1984), a monster hit that finally put Troma on the map.Lloyd Kaufman and Troma have become icons in the cult-movie world, and Troma has distributed over 1000 films. Lloyd has continued his career as a director in addition to producing, and Troma has turned out such films as Non aprite quell'armadio (1986), Class of Nuke 'Em High (1986), Combat Shock (1984), Troma's War (1988), and Fortress of Amerikkka (1989), and Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead (2006), which follows an army of undead chickens as they seek revenge on a fast food palace.",

    "bio": "John Kavanagh is one of Ireland's underrated character actors. Little detail is given on him, yet he has appeared in many well-known films and television series alongside a variety of actors.Kavanagh began his career with the Irish comedy, Paddy (1970), where he played the small role of \"Willie Egan\". That same year, he played another small role in the World War II film, Uomini e filo spinato (1970), which is about a P.O.W. camp in Scotland, whose prisoners are preparing an escape.The next twelve years brought Kavanagh no new films, though he continued to act on stage. Finally, he decided to return to screen acting with the theatrical film, The Ballroom of Romance (1986), which put him in a romance with accomplished actress Brenda Fricker. The film was followed up with the small film, Attracta (1983), and the made-for-television movie, The Country Girls (1983), starring Sam Neill.Kavanagh's next theatrical film was one of the most famous films of his career: the Irish film Cal (1984), starring Helen Mirren and John Lynch. The film was about a young member of the IRA (Lynch) who is seeking to get out of the organization. He meets the widow of one of the IRA's victims (Mirren) and begins a love affair.Moving on from this film, Kavanagh acted in a number of films and television series. He participated in the action film, The Joyriders (1999), the crime drama, Rapina al computer (1987), the independent film, 4 Play: In the Border Country (1991), and the thriller, The Fantasist (1986), among others. Kavanagh's career picked up considerably in the mid-nineties. He acted alongside such classic actors as Mia Farrow and Jim Broadbent in the John Irvin film, Tre vedove e un delitto (1994). Kavanagh then guest-starred in the Sharpe series (starring Sean Bean and Hugh Fraser), where he played the holy man \"Father Michael Curtis\". That same year, he acted in the most talked about epic of its time: Mel Gibson's Braveheart - Cuore impavido (1995). Starring Gibson, Angus Macfadyen and Brendan Gleeson, Kavanagh acted as one of the nobles who routinely changed sides from Scotland to England in the Scottish wars of independence. The film won Best Picture and Best Director, and was a smash hit. After this fantastic success, Kavanagh acted in Una scelta d'amore (1996), a prison film which was written by Jim Sheridan, and reunited with Brenda Fricker in Pete's Meteor (1998). He continued to act in other films throughout the nineties and, as the new millennium dawned, Kavanagh continued on to new projects. After a number of smaller films, Kavanagh acted in another historical epic, the mighty Oliver Stone film, Alexander (2004), starring Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins. Kavanagh played the role of \"Parmenion\", the old general who questions Alexander's actions. After a plot to kill the young leader is foiled, Parmenion is accused of being the mastermind behind it and is murdered. While the film was a triumph overseas, its domestic budget was a fraction of the budget, and it received negative reviews for a number of different reasons. After this, Kavanagh acted in Brian De Palma's murder film, Black Dahlia (2006), which failed at the box office.Kavanagh has rebounded with the successful television series, I Tudors (2007). Starring fellow Alexander (2004) cast member Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the series plays out the story of England's turmoil in the time of Henry the Eighth and his life as he breaks from the Catholic Church.",

By 1932, he began to forsake magic for comedy. He appeared on Broadway (where star Tallulah Bankhead helped him overcome jittery nerves) and then acted in fourteen Hollywood films between 1934 and 1940. Keating was given several starring vehicles, including The Nitwits (1935) (with comic duo Wheeler & Woolsey), Il diavolo a cavallo (1936) (opposite Lili Damita), Con l'aiuto della luna (1937) (with Joe E. Brown) and Prison Train (1938) (with Dorothy Comingore). Alcoholism and depression subsequently hampered his career and he returned to performing magic in the seedier nightclubs and hotels of New York. However, by then, his days at the top of his profession were well and truly past.",

He is the middle son of Bollywood actor and politician Vinod Khanna, and the younger brother of actor Rahul Khanna.After studying in Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting Institute in Mumbai, Khanna made his acting debut in Bollywood in 1997 with the movie Himalay Putra, which went without much success at box office. His performance in his next release, J. P. Dutta-directed Border (1997), earned him the Filmfare Best Debut Award and a nomination for Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1998. After that a string of unsuccessful films followed such as Mohabbat (1997), Kudrat (1998), Laawaris (1999), Love You Hamesha (1999) and Dahek: A Burning Passion (1999). In 1999, he starred in Rishi Kapoor's Aa Ab Laut Chalen; though the film did average business, he was praised for his acting in this film. He next starred in the 1999 release of Subhash Ghai's Taal opposite Aishwarya Rai. The film became a critical and commercial success. In 2001, Khanna appeared in Farhan Akhtar's cult classic Dil Chahta Hai which turned out to be a turning point in his career; the film was a commercial and critical success and Khanna's performance was particularly applauded, later validated by first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2002. Also, the film launched both Akshaye Khanna and Saif Ali Khan's careers. In 2002, Khanna appeared in a Abbas-Mustan thriller Humraaz; his role as a convincing con-artist in this film earned him much critical acclaim, and a nomination for a Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role. Khanna then plunged into the comedy genre with Priyadarshan's Hungama (2002) and Hulchul (2004) that became box office hits. After acting in a string of unsuccessful and lukewarm box-office films like Shaadi Se Pehle (2006), Aap Ki Khatir (2006), Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love (2007), Mere Baap Pehle Aap (2008), Gandhi, My Father (2007), and Naqaab (2007), Khanna appeared in the 2008 release Race. The Abbas-Mustan's thriller was the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film in 2008 and Khanna's performance in a negative role brought him couple of awards in the Best Villain category. However, Khanna's portrayal of Harilal Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi's eldest son, in the critically acclaimed 2007 film Gandhi, My Father that is unanimously acknowledged his best performance yet as an actor. In 2010, he starred in Anees Bazmee's No Problem, co-starring with Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor and Kangna Ranaut.[12] His later releases did not fare well at the box office but his performances in Aakrosh (2010) and Tees Maar Khan (2010) were well-received by critics and audiences alike.",

    "name": "Johnny Lewis",
    "birth_name": "Jonathan Kendrick Lewis",
    "height": 179.0,
    "bio": "Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, the middle of three siblings, Johnny began performing from the age of 5 at a small performing arts school, making his debut as a Chanukah candle.Pursuing the acting profession, he appeared with success in many TV and film projects, handling both drama and comedy with finesse.Johnny was what used to be called a Renaissance Man. He was not only a superb actor, but excelled in the other arts as well. He was a prolific writer, poet and painter.He also was a philanthropist, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to worthy causes, as well as being an active member of a number of charitable organizations.He had seen too many of his friends succumb to the curse of drug abuse, and so he became an outspoken advocate against drugs, using his celebrity status to speak to large groups of educators and law enforcement officials about the dangers of street and psychiatric drug abuse.He created friends everywhere he went. And he went everywhere. Europe, Asia, South America. He slept with natives in grass huts in Southeast Asia, and was the first white man allowed passage to a sacred lake in Laos.Of his many talents, one that he treasured was the mentoring of other artists. Many successful performers, some of whom have reached the top of their profession have ascribed their success to Johnny.His most recent work includes Sons of Anarchy (two seasons), Felon, The Runaways, 186 Dollars to Freedom and Lovely Molly.In late October 2011 he suffered head injuries from a motorcycle accident. Immediately thereafter his thinking and behavior took a serious turn for the worse. He was arrested on January 3, 2012 for allegedly trespassing at a neighbor's home. He was beaten violently in the head approximately 17 times before the police arrived, causing further injuries. In jail, following additional head injuries he was diagnosed by the prison medics as suffering from internal bleeding in the brain. Despite the diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury and despite never testing positive for drugs that year he was treated for psychosis and chemical dependency. Two more arrests followed, including near drowning (another traumatic brain incident). Symptoms of Traumatic Brain Injury include impaired judgement, sensitivity to light, and sudden inexplicable violent behavior. Typical of the misperception on the part of law enforcement officials was the often-quoted remark by the probation official who expressed that Johnny suffered from mental health issues as well as chemical dependency. Prior to his injuries Johnny had never had a brush with the law. And the toxicology report following his death revealed absolutely no drugs whatsoever in his system.In late May of 2012 the Santa Monica Superior Court allowed his admission to Ridgeview, a drug rehab center in Alta Dena, California. Though a drug rehab facility, the rest and quiet were a tonic for him, and he gradually, over the summer, regained himself. He wrote, in a journal entry, \"Felt more whole today. . .more complete. Like parts of myself had been stolen in my sleep and scattered all over the world and they've begun to return. So I think better, my thoughts aren't being sent off on their own.\" He began planning for a return to acting, via the stage, and spoke of possibly bringing Shakespeare to inner city kids. In August he tragically accepted the DA's offer to serve \"just a couple more days in jail,\" in exchange for his freedom. The \"couple days\" became nearly two months, during which he suffered additional abuse and a violent downturn in spirits and health. Finally released in late September, he died in sad and disturbing circumstances on September 26, 2012.",

    "bio": "\"There are those who miss being in-depth with the world,\" explains Nikolaj Lie Kaas in an interview with Politiken on April 29th, 2001, \"but for me superficiality means a lot - that's where I get my drive.\" This is an interesting comment from an actor, whose acting always strikes a deeply personal cord. While other actors strive to close in on life, Kaas - who experienced tragic loss at an early age - seems eager to escape the eye of the storm. It is a disturbing quality that etches his characters in the audience's mind.Kaas graduated from the National Theater School in Denmark in 1998. He first appeared on screen in S\u00f8ren Kragh-Jacobsen's film I ragazzi di San Pietro (1991) (The Boys from Sct. Petri) in 1991 as Otto, the rebel son of a traitor. The development of the character illustrates the growth of moral resistance into full-fledged violent revolt. This somber and masterfully-acted part earned Kaas two Danish film prizes, a Robert and a Bodil.Today Kaas imbues his adult characters with the unsentimental innocence and vulnerability of a child and audiences respond intuitively. Jeppe in Lars von Trier's Idioti (1998) takes on true love, only to lose it. The actor received another Bodil for this portrayal. Kaas makes a narrow escape from type-casting by adding original qualities to the individual characters. He has also done self-parody as a happy-go-easy cook, working for a mafia-like boss in the midst of a murderous streak in I Kina spiser de hunde (1999) (In China They Eat Dogs) and as a helpless man in the throes of love in Blinkende lygter (2000) (Blinking Lights).After imbuing smaller parts with larger-than-life performances, Kaas landed another main part in Et rigtigt menneske (2001) as Ahmed, the aborted son (!) of a working couple. His would-be little sister is the emotionally neglected Lisa. When she dies, Ahmed comes to life and tries to become a real human being. Kaas delivers another masterful performance in this movie, inspired by the tragic tale of Casper Hauser.",

    "bio": "LeToya Nicole Luckett-Walker (n\u00e9e Luckett; born March 11, 1981) is a two-time Grammy Award-winning American R&B singer-songwriter and entrepreneur. She is an original member of the R&B group, Destiny's Child, and has since pursued a successful solo career, topped the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.Luckett was born in Houston, Texas and grew up singing in her local church, Brentwood Baptist Church. Her father, a singer, spread the word of his daughter's talent. Luckett had the opportunity to sing her first church solo at the age of five. \"The lady just gave me the mic one Sunday and I sang\", she recalls. Shortly thereafter, she joined the children's choir and began performing in plays at her elementary school, where she met Beyonc\u00e9.In 1993, Luckett joined the group, Destiny's Child alongside Knowles, Kelly Rowland and LaTavia Roberson. Graduating from the Houston club scene, the group began opening for such acts as Dru Hill, SWV and Immature. Columbia Records signed Destiny's Child in 1997.In 1998, Destiny's Child released their self-titled debut album, \"Destiny's Child\", which included the singles \"No, No, No\" featuring Wyclef Jean and \"With Me\". They were also featured on the \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" soundtrack with the song, \"Get on the Bus\", featuring Timbaland (aka Timbaland), which was released as a single in Europe. \"Destiny's Child\" toured as an opening act on TLC's \"Fanmail Tour\" and Christina Aguilera's debut tour.In 1999, \"Destiny's Child\" released their sophomore album, \"The Writing's on the Wall\". It became one of the biggest selling albums released by a female group and was certified eight-times platinum in the U.S. The album included four hit singles, \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", \"Bug a Boo\", \"Say My Name\" and \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\".During 2000, in the midst of the success of \"The Writing's on the Wall\", Luckett and fellow member LaTavia Roberson tried to make a break with their manager by writing a letter stating \"they wanted an additional business manager since they felt they were losing communication with Mathew Knowles (Beyonc\u00e9' father)\". The pair said at the time they were only looking to secure outside management, but they soon found themselves on the outs with the Knowles family. When the \"Say My Name\" music video debuted in February 2000, they were shocked to find themselves replaced by two new members, Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin.After several months of media speculation, LeToya and LaTavia Roberson began auditioning young women for a new female R&B quartet. Naty Quinones and Tiffany Beaudoin made the cut. The group, \"Anjel\", recorded a 22-song demo in Atlanta. The production company which handled the group fell through and all the members of \"Anjel\" went their separate ways.In 2003, Luckett decided to pursue a solo career and signed with Capitol Records. She immediately began working on her debut solo album and, in 2004, she released her first track, \"You Got What I Need\", a promo single available exclusively on vinyl.Her self-titled debut album, \"LeToya\", was released on July 25, 2006.On the issue dated August 12, 2006, Luckett's debut album, \"LeToya\", debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. As of December 2006, the album had been certified platinum, having shipped over 1,000,000 copies.Her official first single, \"Torn\", was a ballad produced by Teddy Bishop. The song has reached number two on Billboard magazine's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, number thirty-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, number one on BET's 106 & Park countdown, and also number one on Urban Mediabase. Her second single, \"She Don't\", premiered on BET's \"Access Granted\" in July 2006 and was a moderate success reaching number seventeen on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.",

    "height": 176.0,
    "bio": "Michael Rooker was born on April 6, 1955 in Jasper, Alabama. When he was thirteen, his parents divorced and he went with his mother to live in Chicago. He caught the acting bug while attending college, and began appearing in local stage productions. On first breaking into film, his intensity and \"don't-mess-with-me\" good looks were highlighted to chilling effect as he title character in Henry - Pioggia di sangue (1986), filmed in 1986 but, due to its controversial nature, not released until 1990. Since that widely noticed and highly praised performance, much of his career has been spent playing brutes, villains and psychopaths. However, his occasional turns as a \"good guy\" are always well-acted and a welcome change for a talented actor too often typecast.2017 marks an exciting time for Rooker, as he starred in two films premiering just two months of each other. On March 17, audiences saw Rooker in Blumhouse Tilt's indie horror thriller The Belko Experiment: Chi sopravviver\u00e0? (2016). The film is the terrifying yet humorous look at a group of employees that become guinea pigs in a company-wide experiment that leads them to either kill their fellow employees or be killed themselves. Returning to his indie roots, Rooker starred as maintenance worker, Bud Melks, one of the employees trapped in the office building, who may or may not be able to kill his fellow staff member. On May 5, Rooker reprised his role as Yondu in the highly anticipated sequel, Guardiani della Galassia Vol. 2 (2017). The film follows the same group of galactic underdogs saving the universe to a stellar soundtrack. Rooker's breakout performance earned him critical acclaim, as audiences were introduced to a more dramatic Yondu. The film went on to earn over $145 million domestically its opening weekend and has surpassed its predecessor by grossing over $850 million worldwide.Rooker made his film debut, playing the title role in Henry - Pioggia di sangue (1986), a film based on the confessions of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas. It was here that audiences were first introduced to Rooker's impeccable ability to channel a character's idiosyncrasies and subtleties. He has also starred in some of the most iconic films, such as Mississippi Burning - Le radici dell'odio (1988), Seduzione pericolosa (1989), JFK - Un caso ancora aperto (1991), Tombstone (1993) and Jumper (2008) to name a few. In August 2014, Rooker starred in one of the most memorable franchises in the Marvel Universe, Guardiani della Galassia (2014), as Yondu, the blue-skinned renegade space pirate and surrogate father to Peter Quill. The film went on to gross over $700 million at the worldwide box office and spent five weekends atop the box office, more than any other film in the Marvel Universe.On the television front, Rooker is best known for his series regular role as Merle Dixon on AMC's hit series The Walking Dead (2010). Audiences loved to hate the ill-tempered redneck hunter and were sad to see him killed off the series in season three. Rooker has completed a variety of stints on some of the most prominent series on television: Criminal Minds (2005), CSI: Miami (2002), Las Vegas (2003), Law & Order - I due volti della giustizia (1990) and Archer (2009), among others. Additionally, Rooker's talents go beyond both film and television. He adds his voice to various video games, including The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, and Lollipop Chainsaw.",

    "height": 187.0,
    "bio": "Matthias Schoenaerts was born on December 8, 1977 in Antwerp, Belgium. His mother, Dominique Wiche, was a costume designer, translator and French teacher, and his father was actor Julien Schoenaerts. He made his film debut at the age of 13, alongside his father in the Belgian film Padre Daens (1992), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Schoenaerts enrolled in film school but was expelled for poor attendance in his second year. By age 21, he was enrolled at the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Antwerp and was acting professionally in small roles on Belgian television and in Belgian film. By the time he graduated in 2003, Schoenaerts was already named one of \"Europe's Shooting Stars\" by the influential marketing organization, European Film Promotion.In 2002, he starred in Doroth\u00e9e Van Den Berghe's directorial debut Meisje (2002), which was also his first feature film since Daens. With his role in Tom Barman's Any Way the Wind Blows (2003), he proved he was Flanders' young actor to watch.In 2004, Schoenaerts produced and starred in the short film A Message from Outer Space (2004). He also appeared in Ellektra (2004) alongside his father.In 2006, he had a small role as a member of the Dutch Resistance in Paul Verhoeven's Black Book (2006), and landed his first starring role in the Belgian film Dennis van Rita (2006), playing Dennis, a mentally-challenged man learning to adjust to life after a prison sentence for a rape he may not have committed.Though Schoenaerts garnered critical praise for his role in \"Love Belongs to Everyone\", the film that would make him a star in his homeland came in 2008, in Erik Van Looy's Loft (2008), Schoenaerts played Filip, one of a group of married friends who share the rent on a downtown loft as a place to meet their respective mistresses. The dramatic thriller was a smash hit, becoming the top-grossing Flemish film of all time. In the same year, he also starred in the horror film Linkeroever (2008).In 2009, he worked once again with director Doroth\u00e9e Van Den Berghe, playing the hippie Raven in My Queen Karo (2009). In 2010, he played the lead role in Alex Stockman's techno-thriller Pulsar (2010).In 2011, Schoenaerts starred in Micha\u00ebl R. Roskam's Bullhead - La vincente ascesa di Jacky (2011), playing Jacky Vanmarsenille, a cattle farmer who becomes entangled with the underworld of bovine hormones and steroids. Impressed by the script, Schoenaerts committed to star in the film in 2005, and over the five years that it took first-time director Roskam to secure financing, the actor transformed his naturally thin body into that of a steroid abusing brute. His powerful performance in the tragic role won awards at numerous film festivals and propelled \"Bullhead\" to an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film in 2012.In 2012, Schoenaerts got the lead role opposite Marion Cotillard in Jacques Audiard's Un sapore di ruggine e ossa (2012), in the film he played Ali, an ex-boxer who falls in love with Cotillard's character. Like Audiard's previous films, \"Rust and Bone\" received a breathless reception at the Cannes Film Festival with a ten-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening and was a critical and box office hit in France. Schoenaerts' performance in the film earned him a C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actor in 2013.Schoenaerts also starred in the Belgian short film Dood van een Schaduw (2012), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 2013 and won the European Film Award for Best European Short.In 2013, he starred in Blood Ties - La legge del sangue (2013), after being recommended for the film by his co-star in \"Rust and Bone\", Marion Cotillard. Following his breakthrough in \"Rust and Bone\", Matthias started a career in Hollywood and landed roles in American and British productions like Saul Dibb's Suite Francese (2014), Alan Rickman's Le regole del caos (2014), Micha\u00ebl R. Roskam's Chi \u00e8 senza colpa (2014) and Thomas Vinterberg's Via dalla pazza folla (2015).In 2015, Schoenaerts returned to French cinema in Alice Winocour's Disorder - La guardia del corpo (2015), in which he plays an ex-soldier with PTSD. He also played one of the leads of Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), opposite Tilda Swinton and Ralph Fiennes, and played the art-dealer Hans Axgil in Tom Hooper's The Danish Girl (2015).He will reteam with Micha\u00ebl R. Roskam in Le fid\u00e8le - Una vita al massimo (2017) and also with Thomas Vinterberg in Kursk (2018), in which Schoenaerts will play the Captain of a Russian submarine.",

Later, he joined Kee Kuk-seo's influential theater company with its emphasis on instinctive acting and improvisation, which proved to be Song's training ground. Although regularly approached to act in films, he always turned down the opportunity until taking a role as an extra in Hong Sang-soo's Daijiga umule pajinnal (1996). In the following year, after portraying one of the homeless in Sun-Woo Jang's docu-drama Nappun yeonghwa (1997), he gained cult notoriety for his scene-stealing performance in Neung-han Song Songneunghan (1997) as a gangster training a group of young recruits, winning his first Best Actor award.Since that time he was cast in several supporting roles before his high-profile role as Suk-kyu Han's secret-agent partner in Je-kyu Kang's blockbuster thriller Swiri (1999). In early 2000, Song became a star with his first leading role in the box office smash Banchikwang (2000), for which he reputedly did most of his own stunts. But it was with his award-winning role as a North Korean sergeant in Joint Security Area (2000) that Song has come to the forefront as one of Korea's leading actors. Song also starred in Chan-wook Park's Mr. Vendetta (2002), which centers around a father's pursuit of his daughter's kidnappers.In 2002 Song starred in another major production by Myung Film titled YMCA Yagudan (2002), about Korea's first baseball team, which formed in the early 20th century. He came to international attention with the film The Host (2006), which reunited him with director Bong Joon Ho. With Snowpiercer (2013), his third collaboration with Bong, he made his debut in an English-language film with international theatrical distribution.In 2008 he starred in Kim Jee-woon's film Il buono, il matto, il cattivo (2008), where he played Tae-goo, the motorcycle-riding, walther-wielding counterpart to \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\"'s Tuco.In 2015, Song Kang-ho works on 'The Throne', a period drama of palace intrigues par excellence and whose film is nominated that year for best non-English-language film and costumes at Satellite awards. Already in 2016 he makes his fourth collaboration with Korean director Kim Jee-woon and is none other than the critically acclaimed film \"The Empire of Shadows.\" A period drama with a background of espionage intrigue with a very good technical bill.",

    "bio": "Meadow Williams conveys an intriguing mix of elegance and humor, glamorous fashion and easy-going Southern charm that reflect both her humble beginnings on a Tennessee farm and her active Hollywood film career. A classic, radiant Los Angeles beauty who retains the humble nature of her country roots, Williams draws upon a deep wellspring of experience in her film and modeling work.At a young age, Williams started her entertainment career as a television actress and was seen in hit shows such as Sposati con figli (1987), La signora in giallo (1984), and The Larry Sanders Show (1992). Her career transitioned from television to movies when she landed a role in the iconic motion picture, The Mask - Da zero a mito (1994), opposite Jim Carrey. The part led to a role as Kevin Bacon's significant other in the Academy Award-winning Apollo 13 (1995). Deeply moved by director Ron Howard's work on the project, the actress says Howard's influence continues to shape her performances.Most recently, Williams was seen in the action thriller Nella tana dei lupi (2018) alongside Gerard Butler and in the prison action vehicle Backtrace (2018) with veteran stars Sylvester Stallone and Matthew Modine.Williams also appeared as a sexy villainous cult leader in the comic book movie Officer Downe (2016), an indie adaptation of the Image Comics graphic novel by Joe Casey. Under the direction of John McNaughton, Williams played in The Harvest (2013), an American horror thriller, opposite Michael Shannon as his mistress.The industrious actress has a number of projects being readied for release. Up next, Williams will be seen in After (2019), based on Anna Todd's blockbuster novel. In addition to playing a college professor, Williams is producer, along with author Todd, on the highly anticipated adult romance drama. Williams' screenwriting and producing credits let her extend her reach even further to diverse themes and genres.Also set for release soon is 10 Minutes Gone (2019), a crime thriller starring Bruce Willis, with Williams playing a bartender full of surprises. And the soon-to-be-released action-thriller Quello che non ti uccide (2020) from writer-director Joe Carnahan has Williams playing an assassin alongside stars Frank Grillo, Mel Gibson and Naomi Watts. Adding to Williams' very busy 2019 film roster is the drama feature Broken Soldier, with Williams in a supporting role as Ray Liotta's trophy wife, and alongside Sophie Turner and Mark Margolis.The project Williams finds most fulfilling, for the way it dissects one of the most critical periods in American and world history, is the drama Axis Sally, in which the actress stars opposite Al Pacino. Based on a true story, the film has Williams playing a radio personality who broadcast English-language propaganda for the European Axis powers during World War II.The script is adapted from the William E. Owen book \"Axis Sally Confidential.\" Pacino plays the lawyer who represents Williams' character after she was arrested for treason. \"Axis Sally\" is due out in late 2019 or early 2020.",

In 1996, she teamed up with Bullock again in Bullock's directorial debut of Making Sandwiches, a short film that premiered at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival.Spencer made her stage debut in Los Angeles and originated the role of \"LaSonia\" (pronounced lasagna) in famed writer/director Del Shore's, The Trials and Tribulations of a Trailer Trash Housewife, starring opposite veteran actors Beth Grant, Dale Dickey and David Steen (2003). The play garnered Spencer and her fellow cast mates critical acclaim and a bevy of awards. Since then, Spencer has continued to see success as an actor in both film and television, working alongside Hollywood's elite. In February 2009, she was lauded by Los Angeles Times publication: The Envelope, for her brief but memorable performance in the Will Smith drama Seven Pounds.",

After a year, he returned to London to study English and Drama at Royal Holloway.

    "name": "Tilda Swinton",
    "birth_name": "Katherine Matilda Swinton",
    "height": 179.0,
    "bio": "The iconoclastic gifts of the visually striking and fiercely talented actress Tilda Swinton have been appreciated by a more international audience of late.She was born Katherine Mathilda Swinton on November 5, 1960, in London, England. Her mother, Judith Balfour, Lady Swinton (n\u00e9e Killen), was Australian, and her father, Major-General Sir John Swinton, an army officer, was English-born. Her ancestry is Scottish, Northern Irish, and English, including a long tapestry of prominent Scottish ancestors. Born into a patrician military family, she was educated at an English and a Scottish boarding school. Tilda subsequently studied Social and Political Science at Cambridge University and graduated in 1983 with a degree in English Literature. During her time as a student, she performed countless stage productions and proceeded to work for a season in the Royal Shakespeare Company. A decided rebel when it came to the arts, she left the company after a year as her approach shifted dramatically: With a taste for the unique and bizarre, she found some genuinely interesting gender-bending roles come her way, such as the composer Mozart in Pushkin's \"Mozart and Salieri\", and as a working class woman impersonating her dead husband during World War II, in Karges' Screenplay: Man to Man: Another Night of Rubbish on the Telly (1992). In 1985 the pale-skinned, carrot-topped actress began a professional association with gay experimental director Derek Jarman. She continued to live and work with Jarman for the next nine years, developing seven critically acclaimed films. Their alliance would produce stark turns, such as turner-prize nominated Caravaggio (1986), The Last of England (1987), The Garden (1990), Edoardo II (1991), and Wittgenstein (1993). Jarman succumbed to complications from AIDS in 1994. His untimely demise left a devastating void in Tilda's life for quite some time. Her most notable performance of that period however comes from a non-Jarman film: For the title role in Orlando (1992), her nobleman character lives for 400 years while changing sex from man to woman. The film, which Swinton spent years helping writer/director Sally Potter develop and finance, continues to this day to have a worldwide devoted fan following. Over the years she has preferred art to celebrity, opening herself to experimental projects with new and untried directors and mediums, delving into the worlds of installation art and cutting-edge fashion. Consistently off-centered roles in Perversioni femminili (1996), Love Is the Devil (1998), Teknolust (2002), Young Adam (2003), Broken Flowers (2005) and B\u00e9la Tarr's A londoni f\u00e9rfi (2007) have only added to her mystique. Hollywood too has picked up on this notoriety and, since the birth of her twins in 1997, she has successfully moved between the deep-left-field art-house and quality Hollywood blockbusters. The thriller I segreti del lago (2001), earned her a number of critic's awards and her first Golden Globe nomination. Such mainstream U.S. pictures as The Beach (2000) with Leonardo DiCaprio, fantasy epic Constantine (2005) with Keanu Reeves, her Oscar-decorated performance in Michael Clayton (2007) alongside George Clooney and of course her iconic White Witch in Le cronache di Narnia - Il leone, la strega e l'armadio (2005) have cemented her place as one of cinema's most outstanding women.She then starred in the crime drama Julia (2008); in David Fincher's Il curioso caso di Benjamin Button (2008); learned Italian and Russian for Luca Guadagnino's Io sono l'amore (2009); starred in the psychological thriller ...e ora parliamo di Kevin (2011); in Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom - Una fuga d'amore (2012); in Bong Joon Ho's Snowpiercer (2013) and in Terry Gilliam's The Zero Theorem - Tutto \u00e8 vanit\u00e0 (2013). Swinton later starred in the dark romantic fantasy drama, Solo gli amanti sopravvivono (2013) directed by Jim Jarmusch and had a small role in Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel (2014).In 2015, Swinton starred in Judd Apatow's comedy Un disastro di ragazza (2015), and played a Rock star in Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), starring opposite Matthias Schoenaerts and Ralph Fiennes.In 2016, she starred in Joel & Ethan Coen's Ave, Cesare! (2016).Swinton has been confirmed in Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria (2018), a remake of Dario Argento's 1977 film.",

During the following years, Ulliel continued working on TV and was cast in short films such as Alias (1999). He played a young shepherd who was injured by The Beast in Il patto dei lupi (2001), and was then discovered by director Michel Blanc, who offered him a part in Baciate chi vi pare (2002) which also starred veteran actress Charlotte Rampling. Ulliel then took summer stages at Les Cours Florent and was asked by director Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9 to star in Anime erranti (2003) as Emmanuelle B\u00e9art's lover. His role as Manech opposite Audrey Tautou in Una lunga domenica di passioni (2004) brought him to stardom. He has been nominated thrice for Most Promising Male Newcomer at the C\u00e9sar Awards (the equivalent of the Oscars in France) in 2003, 2004 and 2005; he won the last one.

    "bio": "Vince first started to get noticed for his excellent performances at the start of his career in I diffidenti (1987) and Mississippi Burning - Le radici dell'odio (1988). In both these films he played something of a blathering redneck idiot, although there was a streak of pathos in both performances which made it impossible to dismiss his characters as just 'bad' people. In 'David Lynch''s Cuore selvaggio (1990) and Adrian Lyne's Allucinazione perversa (1990), he put in performances which showed he was merely biding his time before his next great role came along. Well, as luck would have it, two great roles came along in two years. As Rub Squeers, Paul Newman's emotional work partner in La vita a modo mio (1994), he put in an excellent performance. However, this performance was nothing compared to the acting powerhouse which was Dolly's Restaurant (1995). In this tender indie film, also marking Liv Tyler's first proper film role, Vince practically carries the whole film, and does so with style. Watching him gradually lose grip of his life breaks your heart, and it is without doubt one of the most underrated performances of the 90s.Vince has not really had a film role to touch this since, but he has been in the cult hit crime show, Murder One: Diary of a Serial Killer (1997), as Clifford Banks. It was a rare opportunity for Vince to flex his acting muscles as a slightly different type of character. Vince undoubtedly has the ability to be a major star; he just needs to be given the opportunity.",

He first met Elvis in high school, where he was a year behind him. West played football for the Memphis Tigers high school football team, boxed in the Golden Gloves and played football for the Jones County Junior College Bobcats playing center.West lived with his mother, Lois West, in the Hurt Housing project in Memphis. West became Elvis's personal driver in driving Elvis and band members Scotty Moore, Bill Black and later D.J. Fontana to different cities in the South for live appearances from 1955 to 1956. West served in the US Marine Corps from 1956 to late 1958 and was stationed in Norfolk, Virginia, which allowed him to stay in contact with Elvis. On August 14, 1958, West's estranged father, Newton Thomas West, died, the same day as Elvis' mother, Gladys Presley. After Elvis' discharge from the US Army in 1960, West was employed as one of Elvis' bodyguards. Over the years Elvis bought West a number of vehicles as he became a world-famous celebrity.West also became a movie stuntman and appeared in 16 of Elvis' films in the 1960s, usually playing extras or bit and supporting parts. West married one of Elvis' secretaries, Pat West, on July 1, 1961. A man of many talents, West became a songwriter for songs that Elvis, Pat Boone, Ricky Nelson and Johnny Rivers recorded, including the classic tune \"Separate Ways\" for Elvis, which won a BMI Award. In addition to the Elvis movies, West appeared in three Robert Conrad TV series Selvaggio west (1965), La squadriglia delle pecore nere (1976) and The Duke (1979). During the 1970s West, his cousin Del 'Sonny' West and 'Dave Hebler' served as Elvis' bodyguards, in charge of his daily transportation and, especially, in keeping weirdo, or potentially dangerous, fans away from him.On July 13, 1976, Vernon Presley, Elvis' father, fired West, Sonny West and Hebler after criticizing what he believed to be their heavy-handed tactics. The three of them collaborated on a book about their lives as Elvis' bodyguards, which was published just two weeks before Elvis' death in 1977. West has since continued his acting and songwriting careers.",

    "bio": "At her young age, Yoko Maki is already a well-rounded actress. 2001 proved to be a busy year for the young actress, beginning with her film debut at the age of 19, in the film Drug, directed by Hiroshi Sugawara. This was quickly followed by Pelican Road. More attention was then garnered with her role as Aya in the highly modernized remake of the Japanese vengeance film Lady Snowblood, re-titled as The Princess Blade. Not one to be confined solely to the screen, Maki spent 2002 acting on stage: first in her highly acclaimed performance in \"Cross\", produced by the Asagaya Spiders and directed by Keishi Nagatsuka, and second in the November 2002 Third Stage Show series production of \"This Time It's Real\", directed by Kyoichi Itagaki. 2003 saw a return to form for Maki, as she appeared in the sequel to the groundbreaking cult hit Battle Royale, Battle Royale II, as the member of one of the \"Wild Seven.\" With her fan-base and critical acclaim growing, Maki continued to live up to such praise by keeping busy in 2004 with roles in films such as Shimotsuma Monogatari, Ren-ai Shousetsu, Koibumi Biyori, and Kansen. 2004 would also be the year of three great accomplishments for the then 22 year old. First, there was her role in the short film, Do Androids Dream of Electric Santa? directed by Hirohisa Sasaki, which saw its debut at the American Film Market. Second, was her work as an on location reporter in Thailand for the television documentary, Ururun-Taizaiki. Third and most exciting of all, was her role in Takashi Shimizu's big budget Hollywood film The Grudge, which was a remake of his original Ju-On: The Grudge, the third of the Japanese Ju-On horror film series. Starring American actors Sarah Michelle Gellar and Bill Pullman, The Grudge was at the top of the U.S. film box office for two weeks straight upon its release. Maki stood out amongst the cast in her first film introduction to American audiences as the doomed caretaker/nurse, Yoko, whose grim fate has left an indelible impression. Come 2005, more film opportunities opened up to Maki as she starred in more principal roles, starting with Pattchigi!, which garnered awards such as the 9th Pusan International Film Festival \"A window on Asian cinema\" and the 17th Tokyo International Film Festival Official Invitation. More roles followed in the films In the Pool, The Summer Time Machine Blues, and A Rain Town. When not appearing on the screen and stage, Maki keeps busy with work on numerous television dramas such as \"The Tokyo Friends\" among others, and appearances in commercials. An avid film fan herself, Maki enjoys watching films in her spare time, as well as keeping active in track and field sports and wire action. As time marches on, Maki continues to keep busy as more and more prospective film and television work opens up to her. And with such a strong work ethic and dedication to perfecting her craft in all mediums, Yoko Maki has a bright, promising, future ahead of her.",

    "height": 168.0,
    "bio": "Shane Ryan began making films at the age of 7 after his father introduced him to video editing at the age of 5. He made action films in hopes to be like and appear in Jean-Claude Van Damme movies, but at the age of 14 he decided to delve into dramas and movies about troubled kids. Ryan directed his own films simply as a means for being able to act and write. He never wanted to direct.When Ryan was 19 he saw Tim Roth's Zona di guerra (1999) and the explicit and confrontational Baise-moi - Scopami (2000). After that Ryan realized he could have an impact with film in regards to things like rape, a subject which has haunted him since childhood. This caused Ryan to become a controversial figure in his hometown when he began making violent films involving sexual abuse. Soon followed underground and indie appeal via the internet before Ryan debuted his first theatrical release in 2007. Academy Award nominated actress Lesley Ann Warren was so outraged by the promotional materials the Laemmle Theatres displayed of Ryan's film that she successfully argued that Ryan's promotions be banned. Then in 2009 the mainstream news and Associated Press attacked Ryan for announcing plans to make a movie about the Stockholm Syndrome, loosely inspired by the current real-life rescue of Jaycee Dugard, with Lia Marie Johnson set to star. Ryan dropped the project to make My Name Is 'A' by Anonymous (2012), a film about convicted killer Alyssa Bustamante, who Ryan felt was getting unfair treatment in the media as well. Ryan makes frequent posts via his Facebook page insisting on Bustamante's possible innocence.Times changed in 2014 when director Albert Pyun (Cyborg (1989)) cast Ryan in his first starring role (in a film other than his own) for The Interrogation of Cheryl Cooper (2014) which then landed Ryan a role in Gregory Hatanaka's Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance (2015) and the upcoming Interstellar Civil War (2017), now placing Ryan in the action category of actors who inspired him to make movies in the first place.",

Whether impersonating relatives, dancing or just making people laugh, everyone sensed something special about the boy. Fortunately, his family later relocated to Los Angeles where, by his early teens. His mother, Janette, runs a talent agency there.Columbus landed work in such television commercial campaigns as \"Mountain Dew\", \"Denny's Restaurant\", \"Nike\" and \"Pizza Hut\", to name a few. As a senior in high school, he was offered an opportunity to graduate two months early in order to see the world with the traveling production of the Broadway show, \"Stomp!\" And, after a couple of years on the road with that famed dance troop, he would parlay his professional success into a stint as the choreographer of Britney Spears' \"In the Zone\" tour. Though a very versatile Renaissance Man who is also a writer, musician and director, Columbus came off the road to pursue his primary passion, namely, acting. His motion picture credits include SDF - Street Dance Fighters (2004), La guerra dei mondi (2005), Save the Last Dance 2 (2006). In addition, he has guest-starred on TV shows like E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994), Giudice Amy (1999) and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2006). But, his big break arrived earlier this year, when he played the lead role of \"DJ\" in Stepping - Dalla strada al palcoscenico (2007), which was #1 at the box office two weeks in a row and grossed over $73.4 million. Now one of the most-sought emerging talents in Hollywood, Columbus can next be seen in a lead role, alongside Lauren London and Mekhi Phifer, in a holiday film called This Christmas (2007). Furthermore, he recently wrapped a starring role in the Warner Brothers thriller, Whiteout - Incubo bianco (2009), opposite Kate Beckinsale. When not working, Columbus loves football, basketball and snowboarding.",

He left school after his fifth year to pursue his dream as a footballer and was soon signed by Morton Football Team.In 2000, director Ken Loach discovered him at an audition at his old high school and gave him the lead role in Sweet Sixteen (2002). The movie was filmed in Martin's home area, including Greenock, Gourock, Inverkip, Kilmalcolm, and Wemyss Bay. The film was a huge success, which shot Martin into full view of the public and even gave some fame to Inverclyde. However, many counselors thought that this was bad publicity because the film has to do with drugs and underage drinking. However, Ken Loach then made a statement that the movie was not based on Greenock and Inverclyde - but was only filmed there, as that was where Martin was located.Compston reunited with Loach for the omnibus film Tickets (2005)",

    "bio": "Joshua Ryan Hutcherson was born on October 12, 1992 in Union, Kentucky to Michelle Fightmaster, who worked for Delta Air Lines, and Chris Hutcherson, an EPA analyst. He has one younger brother, Connor Hutcherson. From the age of four, Josh knew that he wanted to be an actor. In order to pursue his goal, Josh and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was nine-years-old.In 2002, Josh landed his first acting role in the TV film, House Blend (2002), with Amy Yasbeck, Dan Cortese and Sean Faris. The same year, Josh was cast in the pilot, Becoming Glen (2002), but Fox did not order it to series (though, several years later, it was reconfigured as the short-lived series, The Winner (2007), starring Rob Corddry, and co-written/produced by Seth MacFarlane). Toward the end of 2002, Josh appeared on an episode of E.R. - Medici in prima linea (1994).Josh made his big-screen debut, in 2003, with a bit part in the Oscar-nominated American Splendor (2003). His career began its measured ascent in 2005 with a supporting slot as one of Will Ferrell's kids in Derby in famiglia (2005), a co-starring role in the indie hit Innamorarsi a Manhattan (2005), and another co-starring role in Zathura - Un'avventura spaziale (2005), which was originally conceived as a sequel to Jumanji (1995). Despite underperforming at the box office, \"Zathura\" helped earned for Josh his first Young Artist Award for \"Leading Young Actor\".2006 saw bigger returns for Josh's burgeoning film career with a role as one of Robin Williams' sons in the modest hit, Vita da camper (2006). The following year, he landed his first breakthrough role in Un ponte per Terabithia (2007), the kid-approved adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel that co-starred AnnaSophia Robb, whose career was also taking off at this time.Josh starred as Brendan Fraser's nephew in another family-film hit, Viaggio al centro della Terra (2008), and he had a smaller role in the Crash-like drama, Fragments (2008), though by now his face and name were being used in movie-marketing materials. Though it wasn't a hit, Josh's character in Aiuto vampiro (2009) served as a major plot device early in the story.In 2010, Josh co-starred in the critically-acclaimed film, I ragazzi stanno bene (2010), alongside Annette Bening, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, and Mia Wasikowska. The film received several awards and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Josh's performance as the youngest child in a family, led by two mothers, earned him acclaim from audiences and the industry, alike. Josh followed up with an expanded role in Viaggio nell'isola misteriosa (2012), which saw Dwayne Johnson take over as the main character from Brendan Fraser. Between the star power and the allure of 3D, the sequel was a worldwide hit and a third installment is in development.With the announcement that he would portray the beloved \"Peeta Mellark\" in Hunger Games (2012), the film adaptation of the best-selling novel written by Suzanne Collins, Josh became an instant celebrity. In the wake of the movie's massive worldwide success, Detention - Terrore al liceo (2011), a horror/comedy that Josh made before \"The Hunger Games\", was released. Josh was also an executive producer on that feature.Before Josh reprises his role as \"Peeta\" in Hunger Games: La ragazza di fuoco (2013), we will see him in the long-delayed remake of Red Dawn - Alba rossa (2012); the omnibus 7 Days in Havana (2012) (aka \"7 Days in Havana\") (Josh's segment was directed by Benicio Del Toro); The Forger (2012) opposite Lauren Bacall, Alfred Molina, and Hayden Panettiere; and the animated Epic - Il mondo segreto (2013) from L'era glaciale (2002) co-director (and voice of \"Scrat\"), Chris Wedge.",

    "bio": "Gina was born in the small mountain town of Smithers, British Columbia, where her first performance took place at a figure skating exhibition at age five. She has been at home on center stage ever since. As a precocious and outgoing child Gina performed in all her school plays and talent shows.Through most of these early years, as she moved around with her mom and older brother, her first love was dance. Whether ballet, tap, modern, or musical theatre, Gina was immersed in dance performance. As the classical ballet training developed her unrelenting work ethic, it wasn't long before Gina's love of performance began to shape itself into something resembling a career.At the age of fifteen, Gina was scouted by a modeling agency and shipped to Japan. Embracing the move with both hands, Gina schooled herself on the culture and language and the country quickly became her second home.Professionally, Japan was a major break. Gina was unbelievably successful in modeling and appeared on upwards of twenty magazine covers. But modeling was never Gina's passion. While her talent and drive gave her a taste of success, modeling was ultimately a stepping stone to bigger things, in another medium.On returning to North America, Gina went back to school, where she continued to study Japanese and graduated from college at the top of her class. Then, while working two jobs, Gina took acting classes to develop her stage skills. It was during these years that she faced a lot of naysayers, a lot of people telling her, \"No, you can't.\" In spite of - or perhaps because of - this type of pessimism, Gina was determined to become an actor. \"Oh really? Just watch me!\" was her response.Continuously driven and fiercely independent, Gina has managed to achieve big things without buying into the trappings of show business. In a world that revolves around money, fame, and image, Gina has found success and happiness through sheer will and commitment to her craft. She also finds fulfillment volunteering with less fortunate people - Gina has worked with physically and mentally challenged and enjoys supporting bullied teen girls, helping them foster confidence and self esteem.Despite a list of personal achievements that includes starring roles in prime time TV shows and in feature films (big budget and indie), Gina continues to work hard to achieve bigger and better things. She continues to study theatre and classical ballet, and, surrounded by loving friends and family, she is always looking ahead. And up!",

His second feature, the documentary Absent, was filmed in the remotest reaches of rural Moldova in the former Soviet Union. It was designated a \"must-see\" film by Cineuropa. Cine Maldito named Absent one of the top ten films of the year.As a commercial director, Matthew shot the national \"Powerful Performance\" campaign for TCL, starring NBA All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo. It was featured on the 2019 Super Bowl broadcast. Recently, he teamed up again with Antetokounmpo for the 2020 \"Enjoy More\" campaign. Matthew has also directed television and digital spots for top brands such as Turkish Airlines (on-location in Turkey, Serbia, and Romania), Roku, Pfizer, and Icelandic Glacial.Matthew's 2018 television film No Place of Exile, about the modernist composer and pianist Artur Schnabel, premiered on the Arte network. The film was shot in Switzerland, Italy, Vienna, and Berlin, utilizing unexpected textures (super8, drone footage, back-projection) and celebrated German actor Udo Samel to chart Schnabel's course through the emotional and physical landscapes of the 20th century.Matthew's feature film debut, the 35mm Joshua Tree, 1951: A Portrait of James Dean was released theatrically in the United States, the UK, and Germany. The San Francisco Chronicle declared Joshua Tree \"mesmerizing and sexy\", and Artforum pronounced it \"a nuanced portrayal of an entire era.\"Previously, Matthew's short film, Delphinium, about the legendary artist Derek Jarman, was permanently installed in the British Film Institute's National Film Archive. The film was subsequently re-released in the UK by the BFI as part of the year-long Jarman2014 celebration. In 2017, it was presented by the Tate Britain Museum in London.Matthew is shooting the hybrid narrative-doc feature Mosolov's Suitcase in Moscow, with C\u00e9sar Award-nominated actor Kirill Emelyanov in the title role. Based in Los Angeles, Matthew is a co-founder of the production company Iconoclastic Media.",

    "bio": "A true triple-threat, Emmy Award-winner Julianne Hough is known to audiences around the world for her success in the worlds of film, television and music. She became a household name virtually overnight as a two-time professional champion on ABC's top-rated \"Dancing With the Stars,\" before making a seamless transition to award-winning recording artist and making her mark on the world of motion pictures, recognized by the National Association of Theatre Owners as Rising Star of the Year at the 2011 CinemaCon Conventions.In 2013, Julianne starred opposite Josh Duhamel in Nicholas Sparks' \"Safe Haven,\" directed by Lasse Hallstrom, which topped the box-office on its Valentine's Day opening and earned her a Teen Choice Award nomination. Prior to that, she starred opposite Russell Brand and Octavia Spencer in Diablo Cody's \"Paradise,\" marking the Oscar-winning screenwriter's directorial debut. She starred as Sherrie Christian, the female lead in the film adaptation of the international musical sensation, \"Rock of Ages,\" part of a superstar cast including Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand and Mary J. Blige. She made headlines by winning the coveted female lead role in Paramount's 2011 remake of the classic movie musical, \"Footloose,\" and critics praised her performance in the film. She made her film debut in the star-studded ensemble of Screen Gems' musical \"Burlesque,\" working alongside an all-star cast, including Cher, Christina Aguilera, Stanley Tucci, Kristen Bell and Cam Gigandet. She appeared recently in the comedy \"Dirty Grandpa,\" opposite Robert De Niro and Zac Efron, and will next star as fitness pioneer Betty Weider in the upcoming feature \"Bigger.\"On January 31, 2016, Julianne fulfilled her lifelong dream of playing the role of Sandy in FOX Television's critical and ratings hit, \"Grease Live!,\" which was nominated for 10 Emmy Awards, winning four awards including Outstanding Special Class Program. As performed by Julianne and the cast, the show-stopping \"You're the One That I Want\" won the MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Musical Moment, beating such heavy hitters as Ariana Grande and John Legend's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Justin Timberlake's \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" and the Ryan Gosling-Emma Stone duet, \"City of Stars\" from \"La La Land.\"In 2014, Julianne and her brother, Derek, produced, co-directed and starred in MOVE Live on Tour, which sold out theaters across North America. They followed that success with an all-new production in Summer 2015, which featured live vocal performances by Julianne and Derek in addition to fresh, exciting choreography featuring the superstar siblings and the MOVE Company Dancers.They hit the road again in 2017 with MOVE Beyond Live on Tour, their biggest and best show yet, with brand-new stage production inspired by the elements - earth, wind, fire, and water - which the duo have infused into fresh, high impact choreography that only they can deliver. The show brought fans on a journey of dance and music, taking inspiration directly from the four elements as an exploration of the human relationship with nature. The pair was joined by the Move Company Dancers for group performances in styles ranging from ballroom and tap to salsa and hip-hop and everything in between.In 2015, Julianne launched her lifestyle website and blog, Jules.A born entertainer, Julianne Hough (pronounced \"Huff\") always loved singing, dancing and acting. At age 10, she was presented with an opportunity to study performing arts in London, which established her fierce independence and was the beginning of a period of intense training and education. She returned to Utah at age 15 and, after graduating high school, moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of a career in entertainment.Quickly earning a solid reputation for her talent, discipline and professionalism, it took less than a month for Julianne to land a job as a dancer on the ABC game show, \"Show Me The Money,\" and shortly thereafter joined the \"Dancing With the Stars\" tour as a company dancer before joining the cast of the hit series in the show's fourth season, where she was paired with two-time Olympic Gold Medal winner Apolo Anton Ohno. She toured with the troupe again, before returning to the hit show for seasons five through eight, pairing with Indy race champion Helio Castroneves, comedian Adam Carolla, actor Cody Linley and country singer Chuck Wicks. Hough remains the youngest dancer to have won the competition twice, with partners Ohno and Castroneves. Her skills as a choreographer also led to a collaboration with Gwen Stefani on the singer's \"Wind It Up\" video.Julianne earned Emmy nominations in 2008 and 2009 for Best Choreography for her work on the show and in 2015, won the Emmy for choreographing, along with her brother Derek and Tessandra Chavez, her and Derek's memorable performance of Sia's \"Elastic Heart,\" performed live by the singer-songwriter.Following her departure from \"Dancing With the Stars,\" Julianne made several appearances on the show to promote her films and as a guest judge. She thrilled fans when she returned full-time to the ballroom as a judge for three hit seasons in 2014-15 and again in Fall 2016 and Spring 2017.Julianne's self-titled debut album, released by Universal Music Group Nashville in 2008, hit the Billboard Country charts at #1 and entered the Billboard 200 at #3, marking the highest debut for a country artist since 2006. Her first two singles from the album, \"That Song in My Head\" and \"My Hallelujah Song,\" soared up the country charts and she earned her first two 2009 Academy of Country Music Awards for Top New Female Vocalist and Top New Artist.Hitting the road for the first time as a recording artist in 2009, Julianne opened for superstar Brad Paisley and later toured with George Strait, playing over 100 shows. Her second album, The Julianne Hough Holiday Collection, became an instant holiday classic for her legions of fans, distributed exclusively at Target.In 2009, Julianne also starred in her first fitness DVD, \"Cardio Ballroom,\" the first in a series designed to motivate exercise novices and enthusiasts alike on the dance floor. The second, \"Just Dance!,\" was released in 2010, also topping sales charts for months.In 2012, she created her own shoe line, Julianne Hough for Sole Society, a collaboration with leading women's footwear designer Vince Camuto and is highly sought-after in the world of commercials and endorsements, as an international spokesperson for Proactiv Solution and previously as the official spokesperson for Venus Embrace, co-authoring their \"Goddess Guide to Getting Closer\" for the company's 2009 marketing campaign. She was featured in the iconic Got Milk? Campaign and sang an updated version of the Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum theme, \"The Taste is Gonna Move Ya,\" with numerous international campaigns in the works.Julianne has a long-term partnership with MPG Activewear, which was introduced with 12 favorite styles curated and selected by Julianne from the popular line's Spring/Summer 2016 collection and now features quarterly collections designed by Julianne.

It's always my habit to carry my photos, to be precise, my portfolio since I used to do modeling. The minute he saw my portfolio, Mr.Udaykumar who was searching for a new face for his film Karka Kasadara signed me upSubsequently she appeared in a number of Tamil films. Though she got noticed and was most sought after in the industry, she has to wait for her first real taste of success. It happened in 2008, with more serious films such as Velli Thirai, in which she played herself, and the action thriller Dhaam Dhoom. Her portrayal of a lawyer in the latter garnered her a Filmfare Award nomination in the category for Best Supporting Actress. And this sounded the arrival of a leading star in the South film industry. She followed this up with several successful films in Malayalam and is now un-disputed queen of Mollywood.

    "bio": "Angela Little is a screen composer and vocalist originally from Sydney, Australia. Her first big break into screen scoring was on Baz Luhrmann's film \"Australia\", for which she co-composed Additional Music, which led to nominations for national and international awards. She was also the singer and co-writer of \"By The Boab Tree\", which was the first song featured on the end credits of the film, and was among 49 songs short-listed for an Academy Award for Best Original Song from a Motion Picture in 2009. Angela's music and distinctive vocals continued to appear in a range of film, television, theatre and album projects nationally and internationally. In 2015 she featured as a vocal soloist in Marco Beltrami's score for Alex Proyas-directed blockbuster \"Gods of Egypt\", and she composed the music for feature documentary \"Zach's Ceremony\", a coming-of-age story about an indigenous boy navigating his place in both traditional culture and contemporary society. The film had its world premiere at Hot Docs 2016, and went on to screen at the Sydney Film Festival (where it won the Foxtel Audience Award for Best Documentary), Melbourne International Film Festival (where it won the audience award for Best Documentary), and in Australian cinemas in 2017, before being nominated for a 2017 AACTA Award for Best Feature Documentary. In 2018, Angela relocated to Los Angeles after being awarded the Sandra and Alan Silvestri Scholarship to attend the University of Southern California. She has also been recognized with grants and awards from the Australia Council for the Arts (ArtStart Grant, Career Development Grant), the PPCA Performers' Trust, the Ian Potter Cultural Trust, the Australian American Association's Dame Joan Sutherland Fund, and the AMP Tomorrow Fund. Angela's recent projects include feature film \"Back of the Net\", starring Disney's Sofia Wylie, feature film \"Chocolate Oyster\", directed by Steve Jaggi which premiered at the 2018 Sydney Film Festival, and television documentary miniseries \"How Mad Are You?\" presented by Blackfella Films and SBS Australia (which Angela worked on in collaboration with Sonar Music).",

She slowly migrated from dramas to cinemas just as most actors did those days. During her initial days in the cine field, she concentrated more on comedy. She was given equally challenging roles alongside the well known comedian Nagesh. They made an excellent pair and received many praiseworthy comedies. Her role in Thillana Mohanambal was much appreciated and noticed even with the presence of great stalwarts like Sivaji Ganesan and Natiya Peroli (Danseuse) Padmini in the movie. Ever since, she was provided with more scope in varied roles in addition to comedy. She took each responsibility with such an ease which made the Tamil industry recognize her immense talent. She has the distinction of having acted with five chief ministers of South India. She was the female lead in the stage plays written, directed and acted by Mr C. N. Annadurai, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. She has also acted in stage plays with another Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr M Karunanidhi. She has acted in films with Dr M G Ramachandran and Dr Jayalalitha Jayaram who both became Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu later. She has also acted in Telugu films with Dr N T Rama Rao, who became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.",

At a young age, she took up modelling and as a result decided not to pursue further education post her 12th grade. Landing her first film, Yehi Hai High Society (2005), a low budget B-movie, opened the door to small song and dance appearances in various films alongside numerous television commercials.It was her debut Tamil film, Silambattam (2008), which shot Sana into the limelight. The film garnered her large amounts of praise and accolades for her performance of a tomboyish village girl called Janu. Sana received the 2009 ITFA Best New Actress Award for this role. Hot of the heels of this success, Sana tried her luck in Telugu film industry signing up for Kalyanram Kathi and the bilingual thriller film 'Payanam'/ 'Gaganam' (hot in Tamil and Telugu respectively), the latter doing well both critically and commercially. In the same year, Sana also dipped her toes in the Kannada film industry with Kool... Sakkath Hot Maga and also acted in two further Tamil and Telugu films from 2011-2012.An appearance on the Indian reality TV series Bigg Boss, marked a turning point in Sana's career, she managed to gain a lot of popularity among viewers and she ended the show in third place.It was during her stay on the show that Bollywood superstar and Bigg Boss host, Salman Khan offered her a role in his upcoming feature, Jai Ho - where she played the role of Kavita Patil, the daughter of the film's main antagonist. Sana also made her debut in the Malayalam film industry with Climax (2013)_, where she played the role of Supriya, a character allegedly based on real-life screen siren, Silk Smitha.Taking a break from acting, Sana will return to the big screen in Wajah Tum Ho (2016), an erotic thriller helmed by Vishal Pandya (Hate Story 3) and Tom, Dick and Harry Returns (2017).",

He is best known for directing the social films The Major (2013), Durak (2014) and the crime TV series Metod (2015).In 2009, he directed a short film Nachalnik (2009), in which he appeared as a screenwriter, director, composer, producer and actor. The film was awarded the prize for Best Short Film at the Kinotavr Film Festival.In 2010 Yuri Bykov made his feature film debut with the film Zhit (2010).In 2013, his film The Major (2013) premiered in the International Critics' Week at the Cannes Film Festival. The crime drama was awarded at several festivals, including prizes for Best Picture, Best Director and For Outstanding Artistic Contribution at the 16th Shanghai International Film Festival. In 2016, the American company Netflix received distribution rights and plans to remake the film as a mini-series, titled Seven Seconds (2018), which will include 10 episodes.In 2014, the social drama film Durak (2014) was released. The picture received a number of prestigious awards, including the Grigori Gorin prize for the Best Script and the diploma of the Russian Guild of Film Critics (\"For the uncompromising artistic expression\") at the 2014 Kinotavr Festival. Also the film was highly rated by The New York Times critic Stephen Holden, who named it as one the five best films of 2015.In 2014 he became the director of the first season of the crime drama TV series Metod (2015), which was released on the screen next year. Konstantin Khabenskiy, who liked Bykov's work on the film The Major (2013), invited him to work as director on the series. Yuri Bykov notes that he shot the series \"according to the principles of the comics\" in its light form and followed the instructions of the showrunner Alexander Tsekalo about creating a Sreda (\"Russian HBO\"). The series received the TEFI award in the category \"Television Film / TV series\" and several other awards. Bykov refused to participate in the shooting of the second season because he wanted to concentrate on making more auteur films.He shot two-thirds of the film Il tempo dei primi - Spacewalker (2017), dedicated to Alexey Leonov and his spacewalk, but because of creative disagreements he was removed from the project. According to the producer of the film Timur Bekmambetov, the film has some scenes which were filmed by Yuri Bykov. Bykov noted in an interview that is not interested in seeing the movie because the story became drastically simplified and the film's tone became overly patriotic.",
